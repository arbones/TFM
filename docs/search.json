    "text": "Introduction\nOver recent decades, lifestyle changes have driven a global surge in obesity, metabolic disorders, and chronic liver conditions, resulting in the widespread prevalence of Steatotic Liver Disease (SLD). Metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as NAFLD (Rinella et al., 2023), is now the most common chronic liver disorder , affecting approximately 30% of adults (Younossi et al., 2023). As the prevalence of MASLD continues to rise, it is projected to become a leading cause of end-stage liver disease (Miao et al., 2024).\nSLD encompasses a spectrum of liver injury, beginning with hepatic fat accumulation (steatosis), which can progress to metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) (Buzzetti et al., 2016). MASH is characterized by liver inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, with 15% of patients progressing to more severe conditions, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Motta et al., 2023). SLD is often seen as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, significantly increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease (Barrera et al., 2024). Addressing the root cause—steatosis—is crucial for developing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes. Early detection and intervention remain vital to halting disease progression, with non-invasive biomarkers offering a promising alternative to liver biopsy (Tacke et al., 2024).\nThe pathophysiology of SLD involves complex interactions between genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors (De Vincentis et al., 2021; Juanola et al., 2021). A key feature is the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, leading to hepatic steatosis (D. Q.-H. Wang et al., 2013). Adipose tissue (AT) plays a central role in this process, functioning as more than just a fat storage organ. It regulates metabolism, energy balance, insulin sensitivity, and immune responses (Lopez-Yus et al., 2024). The adipose tissue expandability hypothesis suggests that subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) has a limited capacity for storing excess calories. Once scWAT reaches its limit, lipids are redirected to other organs, such as the liver and visceral adipose tissue (visWAT), triggering insulin resistance and related metabolic complications (Virtue et al., 2010).\nUnderstanding WAT’s complexity and functionality is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying obesity-related comorbidities, including MASLD. This knowledge will aid in developing effective biomarkers and therapeutic strategies targeting WAT dysfunction.\nThis study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of steatosis in obese individuals through a cross-tissue transcriptomic analysis of scWAT and liver. We also performed an exome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify genes and genetic variants associated with liver fat accumulation. Lastly, we characterized disease-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in patients with and without steatosis, leveraging transcriptome and genome data to uncover novel mechanisms underlying this condition and improve the accuracy of genetic risk prediction.",

    "text": "Material and methods\nMethods are extensively described in the Appendices 2-4.\n\nHuman cohort description\nThe study cohort consisted of participants from the FATe cohort (Torres-Perez et al., 2015), a longitudinal group of patients suffering obesity undergoing bariatric surgery at Miguel Servet University Hospital (HUMS, Zaragoza, Spain). This study is encompassed for those patients who simultaneusly donated blood samples, as well as subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies and liver biopsies. The FATe cohort, established in 2013, is ongoing, with patients recruited at various time points and subjected to different procedures based on research needs.\nPatients were screened to exclude those with alcohol or drug abuse, autoimmune, chronic inflammatory, or infectious diseases (HIV, HBV, HCV). All participants provided written informed consent, and the study received approval from the Aragón Regional Ethics Committee (CEIC-A). The samples used were stored and processed by the Biobank of the Aragon Health System, adhering to standard operating procedures and integrated into the Spanish National Biobanks Network.\n\n\nCollection and characterization of adipose and liver biosies\nBiopsies (~3 cm3) of AT from both the subcutaneous depot were obtained during surgery with a bipolar/ultra-sonic device (Thunderbeat) and extracted via a 12 mm trocar (Applied Medical) inserted in the left hypochondrium during laparoscopic surgery. Liver biopsies were also obtained during the surgery and were deemed adequate when they were at least 16 mm in length and included at least 6 portal tracts.\nParaffin sections of livers were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). Pathological features of steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis were scored by an experienced pathologist, according to criteria established by the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (Kleiner et al., 2005).\n\n\nGenomic DNA isolation\nSerum samples from patients were stored in the Biobank of the Aragon Health System. Genomic DNA was isolated from buffy coat samples using the FlexiGene DNA AGF3000 kit (Qiagen,) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolation process was automated on the AutoGenFlex 3000 workstation (Autogen). The concentration and purity of the gDNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher).\n\n\nWhole Exome Sequencing\nGenomic DNA was randomly sheared into fragments of 180-280 bp, which were end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated with Illumina adapters. The adapter-ligated fragments were PCR amplified, size selected, and purified. Hybridization capture was performed using biotin-labeled probes, with magnetic beads used for exon capture, followed by washing and probe digestion. The enriched libraries were quantified, pooled, and sequenced by Novogene on Illumina platforms.\nFor the computational analysis we used Nextflow (v23.10.1) with the nf-core/sarekpipeline (version 3.4.1) (Garcia et al., 2020), optimized for variant calling. Sequencing data were aligned to the GATK GRCh38 human reference genome, and Freebayes was used to call variants (Garrison et al., 2012). The resulting variants were stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files, which contain detailed metadata and structured information about each detected variant. The nf-core pipeline was run in the Biocomputation Unit in the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud. The process adhered to GATK best practices for quality score recalibration and variant filtering, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Further postprocessing of the obtained VCF files involved normalization using bcftools (H. Li, 2011), merging VCF files, and removing duplicate variants. The final VCF file was transformed into a binary ped format using PLINK(Purcell et al., 2007), with filters applied for minor allele frequency, genotyping completeness, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\n\nRNA isolation\nTotal RNA was isolated from frozen biopsies of scWAT and cell cultures using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer’s protocol. After homogenization with TRIzol, chloroform was added to the lysates, followed by vigorous shaking, incubation, and centrifugation to separate the phases. The aqueous phase containing RNA was isolated, precipitated with isopropanol, washed with ethanol, and then resuspended in DEPC water. RNA samples were treated with RNase-Free DNase to remove genomic DNA, and their concentration, purity, and quality were assessed using a Nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\n\nRNA Sequencing\nRNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) on the Agilent 2200 TapeStation with the RNA ScreenTape assay. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared using the Novogene NGS RNA Library Prep Set (PT042), involving poly-T oligo-attached magnetic bead mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and PCR amplification. Libraries passing quality controls were sequenced (2x150 bp) on the Illumina Novaseq X Plus platform. The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (Ewels et al., 2020) in Nextflow (version 23.10.1) was employed for data processing, including trimming with Cutadapt (Martin, 2011), alignment with STAR (Dobin et al., 2012), and quantification with Salmon (Patro et al., 2017), using GRCh38.p13 and Gencode v40 as references. Quality control was conducted throughout the process, with mapping efficiencies averaging around 90% for both liver and scWAT samples.The nf-core pipeline was run in the Biocomputation Unit in the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud.\n\n\nStatistical and bioinformatics analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31) (http://www.r-project.org) and the appropiate packages.\n\nPhenotype comparison\nResults are expressed as number of cases (%) or median [interquartile range]. Comparisons between individuals grouped according their liver steatosis were calculated using chi squared tests for categorical data and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continous variables. The significance level was set at 0.05.\n\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis\nWe used gene count data and the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) within DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) for differential expression analysis across different steatosis categories, normalizing count data with the median-of-ratios method to account for differences in library size. Gene-wise dispersion was estimated and modeled to reflect variance across samples, with a curve-fitting process applied to improve dispersion accuracy.\n\n\nWhole exome sequencing analysis\nFirst, we transformed the data from PLINK to GDS format for computational efficiency with the SNPRelate package (Zheng et al., 2012) and applied linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning to focus on significant SNPs. The pruned SNPs were then analyzed via PCA to visualize population structure. We incorporated principal components as covariates in our exome-wide association study (EWAS) to control for population structure, ensuring that associations detected were driven by true genetic influences rather than confounding factors. To further assess potential inflation in genetic associations, we generated quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots.\nWe then employed the snpStats (Clayton, 2023) package to perform a genetic association study between steatosis and SNPs, accounting for confounders such as sex and the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2). This generalized linear model (GLM) approach allowed for accurate interpretation of genotype-phenotype associations. Finally, the results were visualized using a Manhattan plot, which displayed the distribution of p-values across all chromosomes, highlighting key genetic loci potentially linked to liver steatosis.\n\n\neQTL analysis\nTranscriptome and genome data were integrated for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping using R and the MatrixEQTL` package (Shabalin, 2012). No genotype imputation was performed, and sex was included as a covariate in the analysis. The cohort was divided into two groups: no steatosis (liver fat content &lt; 5%, n = 29) and steatosis (liver fat content &gt; 33%, n = 25). eQTL mapping was conducted separately for each group, and eQTLs common to both groups were excluded to focus on steatosis-specific eQTLs.\nTo refine the list of steatosis-specific eQTLs, the most significant SNP per gene was selected, retaining only those with an absolute β coefficient greater than 10. SNPs that failed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE p-value &lt; 0.0001) were also excluded from further analysis. A genome-wide association analysis was then performed for the remaining SNPs using five genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive) with the R package SNPassoc. For each eQTL, the model with the lowest p-value was selected.\n\n\nFunctional enrichment analysis\nEnrichment analysis for each condition, tissue and gene module was performed using the gprofiler2 R package (Kolberg et al., 2020). The top pathways with an FDR-corrected p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered significantly relevant.",

We utilized the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) model to account for the complexity of comparing multiple levels of steatosis. While the model considered all three categories, the reported log-fold changes represent the gene expression ratios between individuals with the highest steatosis (&gt;33%) and those with the lowest steatosis (&lt;5%). Initial analysis identified 9,849 upregulated and 4,682 downregulated genes in scWAT of the highest steatosis group. Focusing on individuals with severe steatosis (&gt;33%) compared to those without steatosis (&lt;5%), and applying a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of &lt;0.05, the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was reduced to 20, with 2 upregulated and 18 downregulated (Figure 1). These DEGs were further examined through boxplots, showing consistent expression changes across steatosis groups, suggesting their relevance in the progression of steatosis (Appendix 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs, in red) in individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in the liver, the initial analysis identified 7,748 upregulated and 6,810 downregulated genes in individuals with severe steatosis compared to those with no steatosis. However, when applying the stringent FDR cutoff of &lt;0.05, the significant DEGs were reduced to 12, with 1 upregulated and 11 downregulated. Among these, IGFBP2 showed the most substantial changes in expression, highlighted in the volcano plot (Figure 1). Expression patterns of these DEGs were visualized using boxplots across steatosis groups, showing a clear stepwise progression in gene expression levels as steatosis severity increased, reinforcing their potential role in liver fat accumulation (Appendix 2).\nTo explore the biological processes and pathways associated with steatosis, we performed functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs. In scWAT, the analysis revealed downregulation of terms related to cellular structure and function, such as microtubule-associated complexes and cytoplasmic microtubule organization, indicating potential disruptions in adipocyte functionality (Figure 2). Upregulation of pathways related to negative regulation of cell growth suggests possible dysregulation of adipocyte expansion during steatosis progression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Liver\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Functional enrichment analysis of statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) up- and down-regulated genes of individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis. The x-axis shows the terms and the y-axis shows the enrichment p-values on the −log10 scale (MF: Molecular function, CC: Cellular compartment, BP: biological process, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, WP: WikiPathways). Each circle on the plot corresponds to a single term. Circles are colored according to the origin of annotation and size scaled according to the total number of genes annotated to the corresponding term. The locations on the x-axis are fixed. Terms from the same GO subtree are located closer to each other on the x-axis, which helps to highlight different enriched GO sub-branches making plots from different queries comparable. Selected terms from different sources are labeled with numbers on the plot and their p-values indicated in the attached tables.\n\n\n\nIn the liver, functional enrichment highlighted lipid-related processes, including upregulation of the PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid transporters, and lipid localization, indicating an enhanced capacity for lipid uptake and storage in response to steatosis (Figure 2). Concurrently, downregulation of bile secretion and detoxification pathways, such as aflatoxin B1 metabolism, points to impaired lipid metabolism and increased susceptibility to liver damage during advanced stages of steatosis.\nThese findings collectively highlight the complex interplay between lipid metabolism, storage, and detoxification in both scWAT and liver during steatosis, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying steatosis progression.\n\n\nExome-wide association analysis\nFor the exome-wide association study (EWAS), only individuals from the two extreme steatosis groups, those with no steatosis (&lt;5%, n = 29) and those with severe steatosis (&gt;33%, n = 25), were compared. This approach enhanced the contrast between cases and controls, improving the power to detect significant genetic associations. No statistically significant differences were found in key variables such as age, gender, body mass index, or liver fibrosis between these groups, confirming a uniform distribution as shown in Table 1. Yet, principal component cnalysis (PCA) of the genotype data, following linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning, although showed no distinct clustering by sex it revealed subtle genetic variability related to liver steatosis. As this genetic variation may influence GWAS outcomes, principal components (PC1 and PC2) were included as covariates to adjust for population structure. A quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot indicated no significant inflation in genetic associations (lambda ≈ 1) (Appendix 3).\nThe EWAS was adjusted for confounders such as sex and principal components (PC1 and PC2). A Manhattan plot visualized the genome-wide p-values, and while no SNPs surpassed the stringent Bonferroni threshold (p = 10\\(^-5.99\\)), 9 SNPs exhibited p-values below 10\\(^{-4}\\) (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Plot of the p-values for each SNP in the EWAS by their position in the genome. The horizontal lines show the thresholds for genome wide significance (Bonferroni in red: 10\\(^{-6}\\), 10\\(^{-4}\\) in blue)\n\n\n\nNotably, genes associated with these SNPs, S100A7, KIRREL3, USP30, and SPNS3, are involved in biological processes relevant to obesity and liver steatosis, such as inflammation, cell adhesion, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism (Table 2). S100A7 is linked to chronic inflammation in obesity, KIRREL3 may affect tissue integrity and liver function, USP30 plays a role in mitochondrial quality control, and SPNS3 is implicated in sphingolipid transport, a process associated with metabolic disturbances in obesity. These findings highlight potential pathways contributing to liver fat accumulation in obese individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene\n\n\n\n\n\nReference SNP\nlocation\nGene\nP\n\n\n\n\nrs3006428\nchr1:153439916\n\n0.00007\n\n\nrs3014836\nchr1:153458724\nS100A7\n0.00007\n\n\nrs1574534\nchr11:126446715\nKIRREL3\n0.00009\n\n\nrs7967182\nchr12:109073339\nUSP30\n0.00008\n\n\nrs28567464\nchr16:55767290\n\n0.00010\n\n\nrs2047233\nchr17:4446887\nSPNS3\n0.00005\n\n\nrs2047232\nchr17:4447072\nSPNS3\n0.00005\n\n\nrs1485206327\nchr17:4447072\nSPNS3\n0.00005\n\n\nrs884250\nchr17:4448345\nSPNS3\n0.00006\n\n\nrs884251\nchr17:4448492\nSPNS3\n0.00009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of steatosis-associated expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)\nAlthough the GWAS identified some loci associated with steatosis, the study’s reduced sample size limited its statistical power, potentially overlooking associations that would be detectable in a larger cohort. We overcame this limitation by performing a eQTL analysis, which links genetic variants to gene expression changes, providing a direct molecular link between genetic variants and disease traits. This method significantly enhances the statistical power, enabling the detection of thousands of eQTLs even with relatively small sample sizes (Yoo et al., 2021).\nFocusing on steatosis, eQTL mapping in a subgroup of 25 individuals with liver steatosis (&gt;33% liver fat) revealed 1,191 genes with significant eQTLs and 18,220 SNPs, with 70.2% of SNPs influencing multiple genes. On the other hand, in the non-steatosis group (&lt;5% liver fat, n=29), 764 genes and 14,510 SNPs were identified, with 56.2% of SNPs affecting multiple genes.\nTo isolate steatosis-specific eQTLs, we compared the eQTLs identified in individuals with and without steatosis, revealing 760 SNPs unique to the steatosis group. These SNPs were subjected to association analysis with the steatosis trait using multiple genetic models. After adjusting for multiple testing, five SNPs were significantly associated with the steatosis phenotype (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Barplot with the distribution (%) of the major (0) and minor (1) associated with steatosis across different steatosis categories.\n\n\n\nIn obese individuals with steatosis, eQTLs link specific genetic variants to changes in gene expression, highlighting key molecular mechanisms involved in NAFLD. For example, the minor allele of rs3127806 was negatively associated with the expression of PDLIM7, a gene involved in both inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses and promoting adipogenesis, linking it to obesity and fat storage processes(Fang et al., 2024; Jodo et al., 2020). Similarly, the minor allele of rs937583 was inversely associated with FNL2 expression, a hypoxia-stimulated gene linked to hepatocellular carcinoma(K. Li et al., 2023). Another eQTL, chr3:9473234, was negatively associated with ETS2, a key regulator of inflammatory macrophages in the liver, reinforcing its role in NAFLD-related inflammation(Stankey et al., 2024). Additionally, the minor allele of rs3739310 was positively associated with MSR1, a gene linked to lipid-laden macrophages in the liver and correlated with steatosis severity(Govaere et al., 2022). These findings underscore the importance of eQTLs in regulating gene expression related to liver fat accumulation and inflammation, offering insights into the genetic factors contributing to NAFLD progression.",

    "text": "Discusion\nThis study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying liver steatosis by focusing on the transcriptomic and genomic profiles of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) and liver tissue from individuals with obesity. By leveraging both whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome data, we identified a set of genes,genetic variants and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), that may contribute to liver fat accumulation and the progression of steatosis in obese individuals.\nPrevious studies have used transcriptomics and serum protein measurements to identify noninvasive biomarkers for NAFLD (Darci-Maher et al., 2023; Trinks et al., 2024). However, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to utilize RNA-seq data from both adipose tissue and liver, along with whole exome sequencing, in a cohort where NAFLD diagnosis is confirmed by gold-standard liver histology.\nThe results from the transcriptomics analysis revealed distinct gene expression patterns between individuals with varying degrees of steatosis. In both scWAT and liver tissue, we identified genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cellular structure, suggesting that both tissues play a significant role in the pathogenesis of steatosis. Interestingly, in the scWAT, the functional enrichment analysis revealed significant insights into the cellular and metabolic disruptions associated with steatosis. Key findings include the down-regulation of genes related to cellular structure and function, suggesting alterations that may impact cellular transport and structural stability, potentially influencing adipocyte functionality in lipid metabolism. Additionally, up-regulation in genes associated with negative regulation of cell growth suggests a possible failure to properly regulate adipocyte size and number, which could contribute to pathological adipose tissue expansion and dysfunction in steatosis. These finding alineate with the expandibility theory which points towards an impaired adipose tissue as root cause of ectopic lipid deposition (Torres-Perez et al., 2015; Virtue et al., 2010). In liver tissue, we observed an upregulation of the PPAR signaling pathway and downregulation of bile secretion and detoxification pathways, in agreement with the previously described imbalance in which fatty acid uptake and de novo synthesis exceed oxidation and secretion in individuals with steatosis (MUSSO et al., 2009).\nInterestingly, we did not find the most common genetic association with steatosis, PNPLA3 (Romeo et al., 2008), which has been widely reported in previous studies. This is likely due to the reduced sample size of our cohort, which may have limited the power to detect such associations. Despite this caveat, we were able to identify some genetic loci that are potentially linked to liver fat accumulation. S100A7, part of the S100 protein family, is linked to inflammation and has been implicated in hepatic steatosis and the progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of S100 proteins is common in liver disease and drives inflammatory and pathological changes (Delangre et al., 2022). KIRREL3 is associated with cell adhesion and may influence liver tissue integrity, potentially affecting steatosis through pathways like PI3K/AKT, which are involved in angiogenesis and metabolic regulation (T. Wang et al., 2023). USP30 plays a role in mitochondrial quality control and lipid metabolism, essential processes in liver function, and its dysregulation can contribute to the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes (F. Wang et al., 2022). Finally, SPNS3 is involved in lipid transport, and its regulation may influence lipid balance in the liver, further contributing to steatosis and its progression to more severe conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Chaaba et al., 2005). The identification of these loci provides valuable targets for further research aimed at unraveling the genetic basis of steatosis and developing therapeutic interventions.\nIn addition to the identified genetic associations, several eQTLs were found to regulate gene expression related to steatosis. For example, the minor allele of rs3127806 was linked to reduced expression of PDLIM7, a gene involved in inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses and promoting adipogenesis, thereby connecting it to obesity and fat storage (Fang et al., 2024; Jodo et al., 2020). Similarly, the minor allele of rs937583 was inversely associated with FNL2 expression, a gene linked to hypoxia and hepatocellular carcinoma (K. Li et al., 2023).\nNotably, two eQTLs were related to macrophage regulation. The minor allele of chr3:9473234 was associated with reduced expression of ETS2, a key regulator of inflammatory macrophages in the liver, while rs3739310 was positively associated with MSR1, a gene involved in the formation of lipid-laden macrophages, which correlates with steatosis severity (Govaere et al., 2022; Stankey et al., 2024). These findings highlight the crucial role of eQTLs in modulating gene expression linked to fat accumulation and inflammation, providing deeper insights into the genetic mechanisms associated with steatosis.\nA major strength of this study lies in its multi-omic approach, integrating WES and transcriptomic data from both scWAT and liver tissue. This allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the genetic and molecular factors contributing to steatosis. Additionally, by performing eQTL mapping, we were able to link specific genetic variants to changes in gene expression, providing mechanistic insights into how these variants may influence the accumulation of fat in the liver. The focus on disease-specific eQTLs, particularly in the context of steatosis, enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying this condition. Another strength is the use of a well-characterized cohort of individuals with obesity and liver biopsies, enabling the precise classification of steatosis and fibrosis stages.\nDespite these strengths, the study has several limitations. First, the relatively small sample size may have limited the statistical power to detect additional significant genetic associations, particularly in the EWAS. Larger cohorts are needed to validate our findings and potentially uncover more genetic loci associated with liver steatosis. Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for the assessment of causal relationships between the identified genetic variants and steatosis progression. Longitudinal studies are required to clarify the temporal dynamics of these genetic and molecular changes.\nSteatosis is the initial and critical step in the progression of NAFLD/MASLD, setting the stage for further complications such as inflammation, fibrosis, and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma. Given this, the findings of our study hold significant importance. Our study identified significant genetic variants and eQTLs associated with liver steatosis by leveraging WES and transcriptomic data from individuals with obesity. The results highlight the complex genetic and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of MASLD, particularly through the regulation of gene expression in pathways related to lipid metabolism and inflammation. These findings provide valuable insights for future research and offer potential targets for developing therapeutic interventions to address MASLD in the context of obesity.\n\n\n\n\nBarrera, F., Uribe, J., Olvares, N., Huerta, P., Cabrera, D., & Romero-Gómez, M.

    "text": "1.1.1 Types and Location of Adipose Tissue\nAT is integral to the human body, crucial in metabolic regulation, energy balance, and overall health (Lopez-Yus et al., 2024). AT comprises white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), each with distinct functions and cellular composition. WAT primarily stores energy, while BAT generates heat by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation (Rosen et al., 2014). Beige or brite AT can switch between energy storage and thermogenesis, depending on physiological demands. Cold exposure and exercise induce WAT beiging to increase thermogenesis, while heat stress absence or a high-fat diet inhibits this process (Pilkington et al., 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Adipose tissue distribution in humans. White adipose tissue (WAT), represented in yellow, is primarily responsible for energy storage, while brown adipose tissue (BAT), in brown, is a thermogenic tissue.\n\n\n\nWAT, more abundant than BAT, varies in individual distribution due to genetic and environmental influences. It constitutes a significant proportion of total body weight, ranging from 5% to 60%. WAT is predominantly located in subcutaneous and visceral depots, with smaller amounts in bone marrow and muscle tissue (Zwick et al., 2018). Subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) contains over 80% of total body fat, while visceral WAT (visWAT) comprises 10–20% of total body fat in men and 5–10% in women (Ibrahim, 2009).\nMetabolic differences between subcutaneous and visceral AT significantly affect overall health. scWAT is generally considered metabolically healthier than visWAT (Després, 2012). It efficiently stores lipids and has a lower association with metabolic diseases. In contrast, visWAT, found around internal organs, is metabolically active and releases fatty acids into the portal circulation, leading to insulin resistance and increased risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases (Després, 2012).\n\n\n1.1.2 Composition and Cellular Types of White Adipose Tissue\nWAT comprises mainly mature adipocytes responsible for energy storage. Adipogenesis is how adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) differentiate into adipocytes, maintaining adipocyte populations and contributing to the tissue’s regenerative capacity (Ghaben et al., 2019).\nWAT also includes various non-adipocyte cells, such as endothelial cells, blood cells, neurons, fibroblast, pericytes,and immune cells, contributing to its functionality in metabolic processes.These non-adipocyte cells perform physiological and pathophysiological functions, interacting with adipocytes through secreted factors.Their diversity and number vary with obesity and metabolic dysfunction development (Lynes et al., 2017).",

    "section": "1.2 Metabolic Functions of Adipose Tissue",
    "text": "1.2 Metabolic Functions of Adipose Tissue\nThe primary function of WAT is to regulate energy balance by storing and releasing fatty acids (FAs) in response to changes in energy availability. However, WAT also secretes various hormones and cytokines, known as adipokines, that play essential roles in regulating multiple physiological processes (Scherer, 2006).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Functions of white adipose tissue (WAT). WAT regulates energy balance by storing (lipogenesis) and releasing (lipolysis) non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). WAT also secretes a variety of molecules that play essential roles in the regulation of multiple physiological processes. Abbreviation: ACC, acetyl CoA-carboxylase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; CCL2, CC-chemokin-ligand-2; DGAT, diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferasen; FAS, fatty acid synthase; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; IL-8, interleukin 8; IL-10, interleukin 10; IMGL, monoacylglycerol lipase; TG, triglyceride; and TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Lipids Storage and Mobilization\nWAT regulates energy balance through storing and releasing FAs, governed by the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis. This balance is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis during fasting or exercise.\nLipogenesis synthesizes new lipids from excess glucose or dietary FAs.This process, occurring in adipocyte cytoplasm, is tightly regulated by hormones and enzymes. Insulin, the primary hormone regulating this process, promotes glucose and FA uptake into adipocytes and stimulates key enzymes in lipid synthesis, such as acetyl CoA-carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Carpentier, 2021).\nLipolysis breaks down stored lipids in AT to release energy for peripheral organs. It is critical during fasting or exercise when glucose levels are low, and the body relies on stored fat for energy. Lipolysis is regulated by lipases, activated by sympathetic nervous system signals mediated mainly by norepinephrine but also by epinephrine. The main lipases are adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) (Grabner et al., 2021).\n\n\n1.2.2 Endocrine Function\nWAT acts as an endocrine organ, secreting adipokines that regulate metabolic, inflammatory, and immune processes throughout the body. The endocrine function of WAT is regulated by nutritional status, physical activity, hormonal levels, and environmental cues, closely linked to its metabolic and storage functions (Scheja et al., 2019).\nAdipokines include over 100 proteins that communicate with other cells and tissues. Leptin and adiponectin are the most abundant and well-characterized adipokines. Leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure, providing feedback to the brain about AT size and status (Friedman, 2019). Adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity and FA oxidation in skeletal muscle and liver, helping maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis (Kadowaki et al., 2005). Pro-inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 18 (IL-18), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) are also produced by WAT and increased in obesity (Al-Mansoori et al., 2021).",

    "text": "1.3 Adipose Tissue Dysfunction in Obesity\n\n1.3.1 Adipose Tissue expandability\nThe adipose tissue expandability hypothesis is central to understanding obesity-related comorbidities, including MASLD. This hypothesis suggests that the body’s ability to store excess calories in scWAT is limited and varies among individuals . When scWAT reaches its maximal storage capacity, AT can no longer store lipids effectively, leading to lipid redirection to other organs (Virtue et al., 2010). This causes ectopic fat accumulation, mainly in visWAT and the liver, resulting in insulin resistance and related metabolic complications through lipotoxic and inflammation-driven mechanisms (Torres-Perez et al., 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Adipose tissue expansion during obesity. AT, adipose tissue; scWAT, subcutaneous white adipose tissue; visWAT, visceral white adipose tissue\n\n\n\nVisceral WAT expansion leads to adipocyte hypertrophy (increased adipocyte size) and hyperplasia (new adipocyte formation from precursor differentiation), contributing to tissue dysfunction (Arner et al., 2019). As adipocytes expand, they experience mechanical stress, increased contact with neighboring cells and extracellular matrix components, and hypoxia due to insufficient angiogenesis. Hypertrophic adipocytes and damaged cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, attracting and activating immune cells, promoting chronic low-grade inflammation that severely alters AT functionality (Després, 2012).",

    "text": "1.4 Adipose Tissue Expandability and Liver Fat Deposition\n\n1.4.1 Connection between AT Expandability and MASLD\nThe imbalance between energy intake and AT’s storage capacity is crucial in MASLD development. Excessive caloric intake, especially when scWAT expandability is limited, leads to hepatic fat deposition. This hepatic fat accumulation, or steatosis, is MASLD’s hallmark and sets the stage for further liver damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Adipose tissue—liver cross-talk in the progression of NAFLD/NASH associated with obesity. AT, adipose tissue; FFA, free fatty acids; MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease; and MASH, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Hepatic Response to Ectopic Fat Accumulation\nIn MASLD, hepatocytes are the primary cells affected by ectopic fat deposition.The accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, initially a protective response to excess circulating free fatty acids, leads to cellular stress and damage (Figure 4).This stress manifests in several ways:\n\nLipotoxicity: Elevated lipid levels, especially saturated fatty acids and toxic lipid species like diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, induce lipotoxic stress in hepatocytes, causing dysfunction and apoptosis (Alkhouri et al., 2009).\nInflammatory Response: Ectopic liver fat triggers an inflammatory response, drawing immune cells and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation results in significant histological changes, such as hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, neutrophil chemotaxis, activation of hepatic stellate cells, and Mallory body production. This inflammation is crucial in the disease’s progression from steatosis to MASH (Metabolic Associated SteatoHepatitis) and fibrosis, and may promote carcinogenesis, leading to hepatocarcinoma (HCC) (Plessis et al., 2015).\nOxidative Stress: When lipid overflow surpasses the capacities of mitochondria and peroxisomes, respiratory oxidation is impaired, leading to the production of harmful metabolites and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Delli Bovi et al., 2021). These molecules induce oxidative stress, which aggravates hepatic necro-inflammatory processes and damages mitochondria. ROS and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) activate Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells, resulting in collagen deposition and secondary liver fibrosis (Paradies, 2014).\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress: Accumulated lipids disrupt ER function in hepatocytes, initiating an unfolded protein response and further contributing to cellular stress and apoptosis (Zhang, 2014).\nAltered Metabolism: Hepatocytes in a fatty liver display altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, often associated with insulin resistance. This exacerbates lipid accumulation and impairs liver function (Jacome-Sosa et al., 2014).\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Liver biopsy for the diagnosis and assesment of NAFLD\nLiver biopsy remains the gold standard for gaining insights into the architectural distortion and complex anatomical relationships among cellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Histological evaluation of MASLD aims to achieve three main goals: to diagnose the disease, grade necroinflammatory activity, and stage the severity of fibrosis (Rinella, Neuschwander-Tetri, et al., 2023).\nFibrosis stage is the most reliable long-term outcome predictor in multivariable analyses, while ballooning injury and portal inflammation serve as short-term predictors of fibrosis progression or regression. These are frequently used together as measures of disease grade. Composite histological scores, such as the NAFLD activity score (NAS), integrate these features and are employed in clinical studies to provide a structured overall assessment of disease severity. Specifically, the NAS is defined as the unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3), and ballooning (0-2); thus ranging from 0 to 8. Fibrosis, which is both less reversible and generally thought to be a result of disease activity, is not included as a component of the activity score (Kleiner et al., 2005).",

    "text": "1.5 Diagnostic Approaches and Biomarkers for Adipose Tissue Dysfunction\nThe rising global prevalence of obesity presents a significant public health challenge, given its association with numerous diseases. Accurate diagnosis is essential for preventing, detecting, and managing obesity to mitigate its health and economic impacts. Various diagnostic approaches have been proposed to classify obesity phenotypes and anticipate metabolic complications.\n\n1.5.1 Anthropometric Parameters\nAnthropometric parameters are widely used for diagnosing obesity and its metabolic complications due to their non-invasive and cost-effective nature.The body mass index (BMI) is the most common method to estimate body fat (Nuttall, 2015). However, since BMI cannot detect regional variations in fat deposition, other measures like waist circumference (WC) or waist/hip ratio (WHR, waist circumference divided by hip circumference) are also used (Guzmán-García et al., 2022). However, these parameters do not differentiate regarding the contribution of subcutaneous or visceral fat either.\n\n\n1.5.2 Imaging Techniques for Adipose Tissue Analysis\nAdvanced imaging techniques have significantly enhanced the diagnosis and understanding of obesity, particularly in assessing adipose tissue (AT) distribution (Kim et al., 2018). Techniques such as Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA), which uses electrical signals to estimate body composition, are non-invasive and widely accessible, making them a standard tool for initial body composition assessments (Brunani et al., 2021). Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) offers detailed analysis of body composition, distinguishing between bone, lean, and fat mass, and is particularly effective for evaluating bone density and fat distribution (Kim et al., 2018). Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are considered the gold standard for quantitatively evaluating intra-abdominal AT distribution (Kim et al., 2018).\nThese methods allow for precise differentiation between subcutaneous and visceral fat depots, providing detailed images of fat distribution that are crucial for understanding the relationships between fat compartments and metabolic health. The ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat (sc/vis ratio), determined through CT or MRI, is a critical indicator of metabolic health, with a higher proportion of visceral fat associated with greater risks of metabolic syndromes, including insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Lopez-Yus et al., 2023).\n\n\n1.5.3 Clasical Circulating Biomarkers\nIdentifying circulating biomarkers reflecting underlying biological mechanisms for increased disease risk is an alternative approach to characterize relevant obesity phenotypes. Several circulating molecules have been identified as obesity-associated biomarkers, classified into adipokines, markers of the glucose-insulin pathway, and inflammatory markers. Adipokines like leptin and adiponectin are critical, with leptin levels associated with obesity complications and hypertension (Perakakis et al., 2021), while adiponectin levels inversely correlate with obesity and related diseases such as IR, T2DM, and CVD (Hong et al., 2023; Kishida et al., 2014). Other adipokines like FABP-4 and visfatin are linked to chronic diseases but are less understood (Würfel et al., 2023). Glucose-insulin pathway markers, including fasting insulin and IGF-1, correlate with obesity severity and diabetes risk (Talia et al., 2021; Wiebe et al., 2022). Inflammatory markers like CRP are elevated in obesity, indicating systemic inflammation and increasing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Graßmann et al., 2017).\n\n\n1.5.4 Omics-Based Biomarkers\nOmics approaches integrate data to uncover molecular patterns linked with obesity. Research in genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics has identified genes, RNA, and metabolites linked to obesity. Novel omic-based biomarkers include epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, and microbiomics.\n\n1.5.4.1 Genomics\nGenetic susceptibility to obesity is determined by multiple genetic variants (Loos et al., 2017, 2021). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify critical genetic variants in obesity that may serve as biomarkers (Müller et al., 2018). A recent GWAS identified 941 near-independent SNPs associated with BMI (Yengo et al., 2018). Fewer variants have been linked to body fat distribution. A meta-analysis identified and replicated 49 loci (Locke et al., 2015). The FTO gene is the strongest and most replicated, with variants linked to appetite regulation (Melhorn et al., 2018), adipocyte browning and energy expenditure (Claussnitzer et al., 2015), or circadian rhythm (Wang et al., 2015), and chronic diseases, including cancers (Lan et al., 2020), among others.\n\n\n1.5.4.2 Transcriptomics\nAdipocyte transcriptomes from both subcutaneous and visceral WAT reveal genes with altered expression in obese versus lean individuals and genes correlated with metabolic complications (Nasias et al., 2020) and particularly fatty liver disease (Lopez-Yus et al., 2022). Recent advancements in single-cell transcriptomics offer insights into adipose tissue heterogeneity and dynamics, identifying gene signatures associated with adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and adipokine secretion (Bäckdahl et al., 2021; Hildreth et al., 2021). Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as miRNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), are also promising biomarkers in obesity, with important regulatory roles in adipocytes and detectable in the bloodstream as circulating miRNAs (cmiRNAs) (Ortiz-Dosal et al., 2019).\n\n\n1.5.4.3 Metabolomics\nAlterations in many metabolites are associated with obesity, including higher plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA), and lower glycine levels (Rangel-Huerta et al., 2019). These biomarkers are linked to IR and higher T2DM risk (Auguet et al., 2023; Tulipani et al., 2016). Lipidomics, a metabolomics branch, reveals plasma lipids as mediators of metabolic dysfunction and obesity-related diseases (Wenk, 2010). Lipid profile analysis has been fundamental in assessing dyslipidemia (Klop et al., 2013). A recent review showed a variable decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids and non-esterified fatty acids in fatty liver disease patients, both in plasma and liver (Herrera-Marcos et al., 2024).\n\n\n\n\nAlkhouri, N., Dixon, L.

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nRecent advancements in omics technologies, fueled by the decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the role of outsourcing companies like Novogene and BGI, have significantly enhanced the capacity for high-throughput data generation and analysis. As the volume of omics data escalates, the demand for advanced, customizable analytical tools increases. These tools are broadly categorized into graphical user interface (GUI) tools, which are accessible and user-friendly, and command line interface (CLI) tools, which offer greater flexibility and are suited for users with bioinformatics expertise. GUI tools are divided into web-based applications, like Galaxy or Partek Flow, and local applications; the former offers constant updates while the latter provides stability for reproducible results. CLI tools, often developed in scripting languages like Bash, R, Python, Perl, and Groovy, are essential for efficient data processing, particularly in parallel computing environments. The open-source nature of R and Python further enhances their utility in bioinformatics. Specialized pipeline tools such as Nextflow and Snakemake improve the scalability and reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows (Wratten et al., 2021).\nIn the context of this study, we leverage Nextflow’s nf-core:rnaseq pipeline alongside R to develop a robust, flexible pipeline for RNA-seq data analysis, aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of steatosis in obese individuals through a cross-tissue transcriptomics analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) and liver. This approach integrates various analytical stages, from data processing to downstream functional analysis, to identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, enhancing our understanding of tissue-specific metabolic disruptions during steatosis.",

    "text": "2.2 Experimental design\n\n2.2.1 RNA isolation and extraction\nTotal RNA was isolated from paired frozen biopsies of scWAT (n=80) and liver (n=80) by homogenizing the tissues in 1 ml of TRIzol per sample (Sigma Aldrich, #T9424) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The homogenates were transferred to a vial and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature to dissociate nuclear components. Next, 0.2 ml of 100% chloroform per ml of TRIzol was added, shaken vigorously, incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, three phases were formed. The aqueous phase containing the RNA was isolated, and 0.5 ml of 100% isopropanol was added to precipitate the RNA. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged again at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by decanting, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 75% ethanol for washing. The pellet was homogenized, centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then dried for 5 minutes at room temperature before resuspending the RNA in DEPC water. To remove any genomic DNA, the RNA samples were treated with RNase-Free DNase (Life Technologies). The concentration and purity of the RNA were measured by absorbance at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher).\n\n\n2.2.2 RNA quality assessment\n\n\nCode\n##### RIN numbers\nrin &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rin.csv\")\n\n# histogram decoration\ngg_hist &lt;- function(){list(\n  geom_histogram(bins = 7, fill=\"darkgrey\"),\n        labs(x=\"RIN\",y=\"Number of Samples\\n\"),\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = 4:10, limits = c(4,10)),\n        theme_minimal(),\n        theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.title = element_text(size=18),\n          axis.text = element_text(size=14))\n)} \n\nr1 &lt;- ggplot(rin |&gt; filter (tissue==\"liver\"), aes(RIN_SCT))+\n        gg_hist()\n        \n\nr2 &lt;- ggplot(rin |&gt; filter (tissue==\"scWAT\"), aes(RIN_SCT))+\n        gg_hist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Histograms representing the distribution of RIN numbers across samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA integrity was assessed using the RNA integrity number (RIN). The RIN was measured with the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and the RNA ScreenTape assay, following the manufacturer’s protocol. For liver tissue samples, the average RIN was 6.8 ± 1.0, with values ranging from 4.8 to 8.9. In contrast, scWAT samples showed higher RNA integrity, with an average RIN of 8.1 ± 0.6, ranging from 6.3 to 9.0. The higher RIN values in scWAT suggest better RNA preservation, likely due to lower enzymatic activity that degrades RNA (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n2.2.3 Stranded mRNA library construction, quality control and sequencing\nThe preparation of RNA libraries and sequencing was performed at the Novogene Cambridge Science Park (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Libraries were prepared using the Novogene NGS RNA Library Prep Set (PT042). Briefly, mRNA obtained with poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads was fragmented and the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers. Then, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using dUTP, instead of dTTP. The directional library was ready after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, enzyme digestion to remove UTP-containing second strand cDNA, size selection, PCR amplification, and purification.\nLibraries were checked with Qubit and real-time PCR for quantification and bioanalyzer for size distribution detection. Five libraries (1 from liver and 4 from scWAT) did not meet the quality standards and were not sequenced. Libraries that passed quality controls were pooled and sequenced (2 x 150 bp) on Novaseq X Plus (Illumina), according to the effective library concentration and data amount.\n\n\n2.2.4 mRNAseq mapping and quantification workflow\nWe used the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (Ewels et al., 2020) in Nextflow (version 23.10.1) to process RNA sequencing data (compressed fastq files). The pipeline was configured to run in a Docker containerized environment , ensuring that all dependencies were consistently managed and the computational environment was isolated. Input data, including sample metadata, was provided via a CSV file, and the workflow was performed by the Biocomputation Core on the Core Cluster of the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud. The pipeline was configured to use Cutadapt for trimming adapters or primer sequnces (Martin, 2011), the STAR aligner (Dobin et al., 2012) with Salmon for quantification (Patro et al., 2017), and the GRCh38.p13 as reference genome and Gencode v40 gene annotations.\n\n\n2.2.5 Quality control (QC) and reads preprocessing\nAll QC results from the differents steps in the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline were summarized in the (Multiqc report). In brief, the initial analysis of raw sequencing data from RNAseq experiments involving paired biopsies of liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) showed similar average (mean ± sd) outputs before trimming, with liver samples yielding 50.4 ± 10 million reads per sample (forward + reverse) and scWAT 52.1 ± 11 million reads. The variability in sequencing depth between samples was evidenced by ranges extending from 31.0 to 85.3 million reads per sample for liver, and 20.3 to 83.0 million reads for scWAT.\nPost-sequencing data processing with Cutadapt revealed a mean trimming percentage of 1.02 ± 0.19% for liver samples and 1.41 ± 0.44% for SCWAT, suggesting a higher incidence of adapter contamination or low-quality bases in SCWAT samples.\nMapping efficiencies, assessed using STAR, demonstrated robust alignment with an average of 89.6 ± 2.9% of sequences uniquely mapping to the reference genome (GRCh38) for liver samples, and a similar mapping performance 90.2 ± 1.64% for scWAT. Reads mapping to multiple loci were also similar between tissues, with 8.18 ± 1.59% for liver and 8.45 ± 1.46% for scWAT.",

    "text": "2.3 Gene expression analysis according to steatosis using DESeq2\nThe analysis began by loading essential R packages: tidyverse (version 2.0.0) (Wickham et al., 2019)for data manipulation, DESeq2 (version 1.38.3) (Love et al., 2014) for differential expression analysis, org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.16.0) (Carlson, 2023) for gene annotation, and gprofiler2 (version 0.2.3) (Kolberg et al., 2020). Metadata were imported, and sample identifiers were established as row names. Steatosis was recategorized into three distinct groups. Gene count data were subsequently loaded, and values were rounded to the nearest integer. To enhance the robustness of the analysis, we performed a pre-filtering step to keep only those genes that had a count &gt; 15 in at least 30 samples (out of 155). Counts of the autosomal regions (PAR) were added to their homologous sequence. Gene identifiers initially provided in ENSEMBL format were mapped to gene symbols. This conversion facilitated the utilization of more standardized gene names in subsequent processes.\n\n\nCode\n###########################################\n# Read metadata ########################### \n###########################################\n \nmeta_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/20240813_metadata.csv\") |&gt; \n  # set the 'prefix' column as row names\n  column_to_rownames(\"prefix\") |&gt; \n  # recode steatosis categories into a new variable with only 3 levels\n  mutate(steatosis_3cat=fct_recode(Steatosis,`&gt;33%`=\"&gt;33-66%\",`&gt;33%`=\"&gt;66%\"),\n         steatosis_3cat=factor(steatosis_3cat,levels=c(\"&lt;5%\", \"5-33%\", \"&gt;33%\")))\n\n\n\n\n##########################################\n# Read count data #######################\n###########################################\n\ncounts0 &lt;- read.delim(\"data/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv\")\n\n\nfilter &lt;- rowSums(counts0 &gt;= 30) &gt;= 30\ncounts_filtered &lt;- counts0[filter,] |&gt; \n  round(digits = 0)\n\n#########################################################\n# Map ENSEMBL gene IDs to HGNC symbols for compatibility with gene annotations\nsymb &lt;- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = str_sub(rownames(counts_filtered),1,15),\n               column = c(\"SYMBOL\"), keytype = \"ENSEMBL\")\n\n# filter out untranslated genes\ncounts_na &lt;- counts_filtered |&gt; \n  mutate(symbol = symb, .before = 1) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(symbol)) \n\n# sum the counts of duplicated genes (normaly pseudogenes)\ncounts &lt;- counts_na |&gt; \n  group_by(symbol) |&gt; \n  mutate(across(everything(), \\(x) sum(x))) |&gt; \n  distinct(symbol,.keep_all = T) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"symbol\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create DESeqDataSet for scWAT data\n# - Select columns from the counts matrix that start with \"SC_\" (scWAT samples)\n# - Filter the metadata to include only scWAT samples\n# - Specify the design formula to include gender (sexo) and steatosis categories (steatosis_3cat)\n# - Indicate that the countData is not in tidy format (rows are genes, columns are samples)\ndds_sc &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts |&gt; select(starts_with(\"SC_\")),\n  colData = meta_data |&gt; filter(tissue == \"scWAT\"),\n  design = ~ sexo + steatosis_3cat,\n  tidy = FALSE\n)\n\n# Apply variance stabilizing transformation (VST) to scWAT data\n# - Perform VST on the scWAT dataset without blinding to the experimental design\nvst_sc &lt;- vst(dds_sc, blind = FALSE)\n\n# Create DESeqDataSet for liver data\n# - Select columns from the counts matrix that start with \"L_\" (liver samples)\n# - Filter the metadata to include only liver samples\n# - Specify the design formula to include gender (sexo) and steatosis categories (steatosis_3cat)\ndds_liver &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts |&gt; select(starts_with(\"L_\")),\n  colData = meta_data |&gt; filter(tissue == \"liver\"),\n  design = ~ sexo + steatosis_3cat\n)\n\n# Apply variance stabilizing transformation (VST) to liver data\n# - Perform VST on the liver dataset without blinding to the experimental design\nvst_liver &lt;- vst(dds_liver, blind = FALSE)\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Data quality assessment\nData quality assessment and quality control are pivotal initial steps in any RNAseq analysis.

The data across steatosis categories (“&lt;5%”, “5-33%”, “&gt;33%”) are visualized with varying colors (gree, orange, and red) to highlight differences in expression profiles. In both scWAT and liver all samples showed similar dispersion and central tendencies in gene expression counts. The uniformity in distribution across all steatosis levels suggested that library depth and average counts per sample were consistent, precluding any library bias in the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n########## scWAT ##############################################################\n###############################################################################\n\n# Extract counts data from DESeq2 object for scWAT and convert to a data frame\n# Access raw counts data from the DESeq2 object (dds_sc)\ncounts_sc &lt;- dds_sc@assays@data$counts |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  # Move gene names into a column named \"gene\"\n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data from wide to long format with gene, sample, and counts columns\n  pivot_longer(-\"gene\", names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"counts\") |&gt; \n  # Join the counts data with metadata to add sample information\n  inner_join(meta_data |&gt; rownames_to_column(\"prefix\"), by = c(\"sample\" = \"prefix\")) |&gt; \n  # Ensure sample names are treated as characters\n  mutate(sample.y = as.character(sample.y))\n\n# Function for boxplot decoration\ngg_box &lt;- function() {\n  list(\n    # Add a boxplot geometry, remove missing values (na.rm = TRUE)\n    geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE),\n    # Apply a log2 transformation to the y-axis\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\"),\n    # Add labels for the x and y axes\n    labs(x = \"\\nSample\", y = \"Raw counts\"),\n    # Set custom fill colors for steatosis categories\n    scale_fill_manual(\"Steatosis\", values = c(\"#99c140\", \"#e7b416\", \"#db7b2b\")),\n    # Flip the coordinates to make the boxplots horizontal\n    coord_flip(),\n    # Apply a minimal theme for a clean appearance\n    theme_minimal(),\n    # Adjust the size of the axis titles\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14))\n  )\n}\n\n# Boxplot visualizing the log-transformed read counts across samples grouped by steatosis categories\np1 &lt;- ggplot(counts_sc, aes(x = reorder(sample.y, as.numeric(steatosis_3cat)),\n                            # Add 1 to counts for log transformation, and fill by steatosis category\n                            y = counts + 1, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n      # Apply the gg_box function for consistent styling\n      gg_box()\n\n\n########## liver ##############################################################\n\n# Extract counts data from DESeq2 object for liver and convert to a data frame\n# Access raw counts data from the DESeq2 object (dds_liver)\ncounts_liver &lt;- dds_liver@assays@data$counts |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  # Move gene names into a column named \"gene\"\n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data from wide to long format with gene, sample, and counts columns\n  pivot_longer(-\"gene\", names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"counts\") |&gt; \n  # Join the counts data with metadata to add sample information\n  inner_join(meta_data |&gt; rownames_to_column(\"prefix\"), by = c(\"sample\" = \"prefix\")) |&gt; \n  # Ensure sample names are treated as characters\n  mutate(sample.y = as.character(sample.y))\n\n# Boxplot visualizing the log-transformed read counts across samples grouped by steatosis categories\np2 &lt;- ggplot(counts_liver, aes(x = reorder(sample.y, as.numeric(steatosis_3cat)),\n                               # Add 1 to counts for log transformation, and fill by steatosis category\n                               y = counts + 1, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n      # Apply the gg_box function for consistence\n      gg_box()\n\n# Combine the two boxplots (scWAT and liver) into a single figure with labeled panels\nplot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c('a', 'b'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Boxplots representing the distribution of log2-transformed read counts across samples (a: scWAT, b: liver), with distinct coloration representing different steatosis categories.

The biplot (Figure 2.3) shows no outliers and tight clusters for both scWAT (a) and liver (b) samples.

Initially, we configured the DESeq2 object using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) , which allowed us to account for all three steatosis categories: &lt;5% (no steatosis), 5-33% (moderate steatosis), and &gt;33% (severe steatosis). This approach enabled the model to consider the gene expression changes across the full spectrum of steatosis progression.\n\n\nCode\n# Perform differential expression analysis for scWAT data\n# Run DESeq2 using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) controlling for the effect of gender (sexo)\ndex_sc &lt;- DESeq(dds_sc, test = \"LRT\", reduced = ~ sexo)    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n## Extract and visualize size factors from the DESeq2 object\nsizeFactors(dex_sc) |&gt; as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(\"Sample\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::rename(`Size Factors`= \"sizeFactors(dex_sc)\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Sample = str_sub (Sample, 4,6)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Sample, y= `Size Factors`))+\n  geom_col(col=\"darkgrey\", fill = \"grey\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20),\n        axis.text = element_text(size=18))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Calculated factor sizes for each sample using the median of ratios method.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the hood of the DESeq function the normalization of count data was performed using the median-of-ratios method (Anders et al., 2010), ensuring that variations in library size did not bias the analysis. This method adjusted each sample’s read counts by a size factor, calculated to equalize the median of ratios across all samples (Figure 2.4).\nTo address the intrinsic variability in count data, DESeq2 estimates gene-wise dispersion, which reflects the variance deviation from the mean for each gene. This step is crucial because RNA-seq data typically exhibit variance that exceeds the mean, particularly when expression levels are low. Dispersion parameters were calculated for each gene (Black dots in Figure 2.5), taking into account the mean expression levels and observed variance.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate a plot of dispersion estimates using the DESeq2 object\nd2 &lt;- plotDispEsts(dex_sc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Dispersion plot. Black dots represents single genes and the intial maximum likelihood dispersion estimate (MLE) given the observed data, the red line is the fitted curve to gene-wise dispersion estimates, while blue dots are the shrunken gene-wise dispersion estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene-wise dispersions were then modeled through a curve-fitting process, to generalize dispersion behavior across the dataset. The curve, represented in red in Figure 2.5, illustrates the inverse relationship between mean expression and dispersion, a typical observation in RNA-seq data. The final analytical step involved shrinking the initial raw dispersion estimates towards the values predicted by the fitted curve (Blue dots).\nOur analysis revealed a pattern where dispersion generally decreased with increasing mean expression levels, indicating a stable and consistent data quality across our sample set. The limited shrinkage observed was attributable to the large number of biological replicates, which provided a robust basis for the dispersion estimates.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Testing for differential expression\n\n\nCode\n# Use DESeq2 to extract results from the differential expression analysis with FDR adjustment\nres_sc &lt;- results(dex_sc, pAdjustMethod = \"fdr\", independentFiltering = TRUE)\n\n# Convert the results to a data frame for easier manipulation\nres_sc_df &lt;- res_sc |&gt; \n  as.data.frame()\n\n# Filter the results to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\n# Keep only those genes with an adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05\ndegs_sc &lt;- res_sc_df |&gt; \n  filter(padj &lt; 0.05)\n\n# Count the number of upregulated genes (log2FoldChange &gt; 0)\nup &lt;- sum(res_sc_df$log2FoldChange &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Count the number of downregulated genes (log2FoldChange &lt; 0)\ndown &lt;- sum(res_sc_df$log2FoldChange &lt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nBecause we were mostly interested in transcriptional changes that may precede the initiation of the steatosis process, we focused on the contrast between those individuals with the highest liver steatosis extension (&gt;33%) and their counterparts with no steatosis. In our differential expression analysis using DESeq2 with the LRT model, we initially identified 9849 genes as upregulated and 4682 as downregulated in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) of individuals according their steatosis degree. Comparing these two groups and applying a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of less than 0.05, the number of statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was greatly reduced to 20. Of these, only 2 genes were found to be upregulated, while 18 were downregulated (Table 2.1)\n\n\nCode\n# Select relevant columns from the significant DEGs in scWAT data\ndegs_sc |&gt; \n  # Select the log2 fold change, p-value, and adjusted p-value (FDR)\n  select(log2FoldChange, pvalue, FDR = \"padj\") |&gt; \n  # Arrange the results by the FDR (adjusted p-value) in ascending order\n  arrange(FDR) |&gt; \n  # Change p-value formats\n  mutate(pvalue = format.pval(pvalue,eps = 0.00001, digits =1),\n         FDR = format.pval(FDR, eps = 0.001, digits = 1)) |&gt; \n  # Create a formatted table with specified number of digits for each column\n  kbl(digits = c(2, 5, 3)) |&gt; \n  # Apply striped styling to the table for better visual presentation\n  kable_styling(\"striped\") |&gt; \n  column_spec(1,italic = T)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT.

This approach allows us to observe how the expression of these significant genes varies across different degrees of steatosis, offering deeper insights into the potential role these genes play in the progression of steatosis. The boxplots highlight the consistency of expression changes across groups, reinforcing the relevance of these DEGs in the context of steatosis severity.\n\n\nCode\n# Normalize the counts for scWAT data and transpose the matrix\ncounts_norm_sc &lt;- t(counts(dex_sc, normalized = TRUE))\n\n# Subset the metadata for scWAT to match the normalized counts\nmeta_data_sc &lt;- meta_data[rownames(counts_norm_sc), c(\"sexo\", \"steatosis_3cat\")]\n\n# Create a data frame combining normalized counts with metadata\n# Convert the transposed counts to a data frame\nsc &lt;- as.data.frame(counts_norm_sc) |&gt; \n  # Select columns corresponding to the DEGs identified in scWAT\n  select(rownames(degs_sc)) |&gt; \n  # Bind the selected DEGs with the corresponding metadata\n  bind_cols(meta_data_sc) |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data to long format for ggplot, with Gene and Normalized Counts columns\n  pivot_longer(1:nrow(degs_sc), names_to = \"Gene\", values_to = \"Normalized Counts\") |&gt; \n  # Add 1 to avoid infinity in the log scale \n  mutate(`Normalized Counts`=`Normalized Counts` + 1)\n\n\n\n# Function for decorating boxplots of DEGs\ngg_degs &lt;- function() { \n  list(\n    # Apply a log2 transformation to the y-axis (normalized counts)\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\"),\n    # Set the x-axis label to \"Steatosis\"\n    labs(x = \"\\nSteatosis\"),\n    # Add a boxplot geometry with specified width and no outliers\n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, outliers = FALSE),\n    # Add jittered points for individual observations with transparency\n    geom_jitter(width = 0.25, size = 2, alpha = 0.3),\n    # Add statistical comparison (Kruskal-Wallis test) labels to the plot\n    stat_compare_means(aes(label = paste0(\"p= \", ..p.format..)), \n                       method = \"kruskal.test\",\n                       label.x.npc = 0.3,\n                       label.y.npc = 0.8,\n                       size = 4),\n    # Set custom fill colors for the steatosis categories\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#99c140\", \"#e7b416\", \"#db7b2b\")),\n    # Apply a minimal theme for clean appearance\n    theme_minimal(),\n    # Create facets for each gene, allowing free scaling on the y-axis, with 4 columns of facets\n    facet_wrap(~ Gene, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 4),\n    # Customize theme elements: remove legend, adjust text sizes, and rotate x-axis labels\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          strip.text = element_text(size = 13),\n          axis.title = element_text(size = 13),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 20),\n          strip.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n  )\n}\n\n##############################################\n\n# Plot the normalized counts across steatosis categories for each DEG in scWAT\nggplot(sc, aes(x = steatosis_3cat, y = `Normalized Counts`, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n  # Apply the custom ggplot decorations for DEGs\n  gg_degs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Boxplots of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT according to the 3 groups of steatosis.Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the normalized counts, with the line inside the box denoting the median.

Consistent with our observations in the scWAT analysis, the liver data revealed that dispersion generally decreased as mean expression levels increased (Figure 2.9). The limited shrinkage of dispersion estimates, as seen in scWAT, can be attributed to the large number of biological replicates.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate a plot of dispersion estimates using the DESeq2 object\nd2 &lt;- plotDispEsts(dex_liver)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Dispersion plot.

However, when applying a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of less than 0.05 to identify statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the number of significant DEGs was markedly reduced to 12. Among these, only 1 genes were found to be upregulated, while 11 were downregulated (Table 2.2). The volcano plot (Figure 2.10) illustrates the differential expression of genes in the liver according to steatosis. Among the thousands of genes analyzed, only IGFBP2 showed FDR &lt; 0.05 and substantial changes in expression (Log2 FC &gt; 1).\n\n\nCode\n# Select relevant columns from the significant DEGs in liver data\ndegs_liver |&gt; \n  # Select the log2 fold change, p-value, and adjusted p-value (FDR)\n  select(log2FoldChange, pvalue, FDR = \"padj\") |&gt; \n  # Arrange the results by the FDR (adjusted p-value) in ascending order\n  arrange(FDR) |&gt; \n  # Change p-value formats\n  mutate(pvalue = format.pval(pvalue,eps = 0.00001, digits =1),\n         FDR = format.pval(FDR, eps = 0.001, digits = 1)) |&gt;\n  # Create a formatted table with specified number of digits for each column\n  kbl(digits = c(2, 5, 3)) |&gt; \n  # Apply striped styling to the table for better visual presentation\n  kable_styling(\"striped\") |&gt; \n  column_spec(1, italic = T)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver. fdr: false discovery rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog2FoldChange\npvalue\nFDR\n\n\n\n\nIL32\n0.81\n&lt; 0.00001\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nIGFBP2\n-1.37\n&lt; 0.00001\n0.008\n\n\nAHCY\n-0.59\n0.00003\n0.014\n\n\nRN7SL1\n-0.72\n0.00003\n0.014\n\n\nRN7SL2\n-0.69\n0.00012\n0.024\n\n\nAPOF\n-0.56\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nCYP3A4\n-0.63\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nSERPINA1\n-0.55\n0.00009\n0.024\n\n\nAKR7A3\n-0.67\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nMAT1A\n-0.35\n0.00011\n0.024\n\n\nPC\n-0.43\n0.00011\n0.024\n\n\nSERPINA3\n-0.48\n0.00023\n0.036\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a volcano plot for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver\nEnhancedVolcano(res_liver,\n    # Label the points on the plot with gene names from the rownames of res_liver\n    lab = rownames(res_liver),\n    # Set the main title of the plot\n    title = \"Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver\",\n    # Set the subtitle indicating the comparison groups\n    subtitle = \"&gt;33%  vs. &lt;5% steatosis\",\n     ylab = bquote(~-Log[10] ~ italic(FDR)),\n    # Customize the legend labels for different categories of DEGs\n    legendLabels = c(\"NS\", \n                     expression(paste(\"|\",Log[2], \" FC\",\"|\", \" &gt;1\")), \n                     \"FDR &lt; 0.05\", \n                     expression(paste(\"FDR &lt; 0.05 and \",\"|\",Log[2], \" FC\",\"|\", \" &gt;1\"))),\n    # Set the caption below the plot (empty in this case)\n    caption = \"\",\n    # Set the size and font of the labels on the plot\n    labSize = 4, labFace = \"italic\",\n    # Position the legend to the right of the plot\n    legendPosition = 'no',\n    # Draw lines connecting labels to their corresponding points\n    drawConnectors = TRUE,\n    # Connect labels to points in both directions (from left and right)\n    directionConnectors = \"both\",\n    # Allow for an infinite number of overlapping points to be labeled\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    # Set the fold change cutoff for highlighting DEGs\n    FCcutoff = 0.001,\n    # Specify the column to use for the p-value cutoff\n    pCutoffCol = \"padj\",\n    # Set the p-value cutoff for significance\n    pCutoff = 0.05,\n    cutoffLineType = \"blank\",\n    # Set the x-axis to represent log2 fold change\n    x = 'log2FoldChange',\n    # Set the y-axis to represent the p-value\n    y = 'padj',\n    ylim = c(0,3.5),\n    xlim= c(-1.5,1.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Volcano plot showing liver DEGs (in red) in individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter identifying the DEGs in the liver, we analyzed their expression patterns using boxplots across the three steatosis groups (Figure 2.11).

Utilizing the gprofiler2 ( version 0.2.3), we analyzed gene sets against databases including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and WikiPathways (WP) to identify enriched biological functions, cellular components, and pathways (Figure 2.12).\nThe enrichment analysis was conducted with a less stringent p-value cut-off (p&lt;0.001 instead of FDR &lt; 0.05) to enhance the detection of functionally relevant gene sets. This yielded 8 up-regulated and 72 down-regulated genes in the scWAT and 22 up-regulated and 38 down-regulated genes in the liver according to individuals´steatosis degree.\n\nCode\n# Visuaaize enrichment results\n\n## scWAT\ng &lt;- gostplot(enrich_sc, capped = F, interactive = F) + ylim(-1,5)\n \n\ngg &lt;-  publish_gostplot(g, highlight_terms = c(\"GO:0005875\",\"GO:0031122\",\"GO:0030308\", \"GO:0045926\"),\n                  width = NA, height = NA, filename = NULL)\n\n## Liver\n\nl &lt;- gostplot(enrich_liver, capped = F, interactive = F)+ ylim(-1,7)\n \n\nll &lt;-  publish_gostplot(l, highlight_terms = c(\"GO:0005324\",\"GO:0034185\",\"GO:0005811\",\"GO:0006950\",\"GO:0010876\",\"KEGG:04976\", \"KEGG:03320\",\"WP:WP699\", \"WP:WP3942\", \"WP:WP5061\"),\n                  width = NA, height = NA, filename = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Liver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Functional enrichment analysis of statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) up- and down-regulated genes of individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis.The x-axis shows the terms and the y-axis shows the enrichment p-values on the −log10 scale (MF: Molecular function, CC: Cellular compartment, BP: biological process, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, WP: WikiPathways). Each circle on the plot corresponds to a single term. Circles are colored according to the origin of annotation and size scaled according to the total number of genes annotated to the corresponding term. The locations on the x-axis are fixed. Terms from the same GO subtree are located closer to each other on the x-axis, which helps to highlight different enriched GO sub-branches making plots from different queries comparable. Selected terms from different sources are labeled with numbers on the plot and their p-values indicated in the attached tables .\n\n\n\nIn the scWAT, the functional enrichment analysis revealed significant insights into the cellular and metabolic disruptions associated with varying degrees of steatosis (Figure 2.12 (a)). Key findings include the down-regulation of terms related to cellular structure and function, such as microtubule associated complex (GO:0005875) and cytoplasmic microtubule organization (GO:0031122), suggesting alterations that may impact cellular transport and structural stability, potentially influencing adipocyte functionality in lipid metabolism. Additionally, up-regulation in terms associated with negative regulation of cell growth (GO:0030308 and GO:0045926) suggests a possible failure to properly regulate adipocyte size and number, which could contribute to pathological adipose tissue expansion and dysfunction in steatosis.\nIn the liver, the functional enrichment analysis highlighted key metabolic functions impacted by varying degrees of steatosis (Figure 2.12 (b)). Lipid accumulation-related terms were notably represented, with up-regulation of PPAR signaling pathway (KEGG:03320), lipid Droplets (GO:0005811), fatty Acid transporters (WP:WP5061), apolipoprotein binding (GO:0034185), and lipid localization (GO:0010876) indicating an enhanced capacity for fatty acid uptake and lipid storage, potentially as an adaptive response to excessive lipid accumulation. Concurrently, down-regulation of Bile Secretion (KEGG:04976) could impair lipid digestion and absorption, exacerbating lipid buildup in the liver. Furthermore, the response to stress biological process (GO:0006950) was up-regulated during steatosis while the aflatoxin B1 metabolism (WP:WP699) was down-regulated, possibly reflecting and exhaustion of the detoxification processes, thereby increasing susceptibility to liver damage. These findings collectively highlight a complex interplay of lipid metabolism, storage, and detoxification pathways in the liver, reflecting both adaptive and pathological responses to steatosis.",

    "text": "2.5 Conclusion\nThis cross-tissue transcriptomics analysis, spanning both subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) and liver, has provided a comprehensive view of the differential gene expression associated with steatosis in obese individuals. By identifying a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across these tissues, this omics technique offers potential targets that could be manipulated to ameliorate steatosis or utilized as biomarkers for early detection and progression monitoring of the condition. Furthermore, the functional enrichment analysis has shed light on the distinct metabolic landscapes of scWAT and liver during steatosis, highlighting the specific cellular pathways and functions disrupted in each tissue. These insights not only deepen our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of steatosis but also pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches in the treatment and management of obesity-related steatosis.\n\n\n\n\nAnders, S., & Huber, W.

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nAdipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis are interconnected metabolic disorders with significant global health implications, both of which are highly heritable (Anstee et al., 2013). Understanding their genetic basis is essential for unraveling their etiology and progression.\nExome sequencing, which targets the coding regions of the genome, offers a powerful and cost-effective approach to identify the genetic variants underlying these conditions and to discover potential biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic intervention. Exome sequencing is particularly advantageous because it focuses on exonic regions, where most disease-related variants are found, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the genetic diversity that drives complex traits like adipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis. This precision is key to understanding the biological mechanisms involved and translating genetic findings into clinical practice.\nGenetic association studies, such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Exome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS), play a critical role in this research. While GWAS explores common genetic variants across the entire genome, EWAS zeroes in on variants within the exome, making it especially useful for identifying causal mutations in coding regions (Battram et al., 2022). Key genes implicated in adipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis include PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and GCKR, which are involved in metabolic processes and fat distribution within cells, playing critical roles in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Anstee et al., 2013). However, since no single SNP can adequately predict complex diseases, polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which aggregate the risk from multiple variants, offer a more effective predictive tool (Chatterjee et al., 2016). PRSs are being developed in the field of fatty liver disease (FLD), where both common and rare variants have been strongly linked to the risk of progressive NAFLD, independent of clinical factors like liver fibrosis severity (Dongiovanni et al., 2017). However, their clinical utility remains to be fully established. Our study aimed to perform an EWAS to identify genes associated with liver fat accumulation in a cohort of obese patients. By focusing on the exonic regions of the genome, we sought to uncover genetic variants that contribute to the pathophysiology of liver steatosis in obesity, with the goal of identifying potential biomarkers for early detection and tailored therapeutic interventions.",

    "section": "3.2 Experimental design",
    "text": "3.2 Experimental design\n\n3.2.1 DNA isolation and extraction\nSerum samples from patients were stored in the Biobank of the Aragon Health System. Genomic DNA was isolated from buffy coat samples using the FlexiGene DNA AGF3000 kit (Qiagen,) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolation process was automated on the AutoGenFlex 3000 workstation (Autogen).\n\n\n3.2.2 Library Preparation and Sequencing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Library Preparation Workflow\n\n\n\nThe genomic DNA was randomly sheared into short fragments with the size of 180-280 bp. The obtained fragments were end repaired, A-tailed, and further ligated with Illumina adapters. The fragments with adapters were PCR amplified, size selected, and purified. Hybridization capture of libraries was proceeded according to the following procedures. Briefly, the prepped libraries were hybridized in the buffer with biotin-labeled probes, and magnetic beads with streptavidin were used to capture the exons of genes. Subsequently, non-hybridized fragments were washed out and probes were digested. The captured libraries were enriched by PCR amplification (Figure 3.1).\nThe library was checked with Qubit and real-time PCR for quantification and bioanalyzer for size distribution detection. Quantified libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina platforms, according to effective library concentration and data amount required.\n\n\n3.2.3 Variant Calling workflow\nThe computational analysis was managed using Nextflow (v23.10.1), a scalable and reproducible workflow management system that allows for seamless execution of complex bioinformatics pipelines. The workflow was built on the nf-core framework, which provides community-curated pipelines, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across analyses (Ewels et al., 2020). The nf-core/sarek pipeline (version 3.4.1) (Garcia et al., 2020) was utilized specifically for variant calling. This pipeline is optimized for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted sequencing data, commonly used in cancer genomics studies.\nThe pipeline was executed by the Biocomputation Core on the Core Cluster of the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud and configured to run in a Docker containerized environment. This setup enhances reproducibility and facilitates the seamless execution of the analysis across different computing platforms.\nInput data, comprising clean fastq.gz files, were organized in a CSV file (samplesheet.csv) that included essential metadata such as sample identifiers and sequencing data paths. The sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome GATK GRCh38, providing a standardized basis for variant calling. Freebayes, a variant caller known for its efficacy in detecting small variants like SNPs and indels (Garrison et al., 2012), was employed to call variants. The resulting variants were stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files, which contain detailed metadata and structured information about each detected variant.\nBy adhering to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices, including recommendations for quality score recalibration and variant filtering, this workflow ensures that the variant calling process is both accurate and reliable. The stringent quality controls integrated into the GATK framework further enhance the robustness of the results.\n\n\n3.2.4 Quality control (QC) and reads preprocessing\nAll QC results from the differents steps in the nf-core/sarek pipeline were summarized in the (Multiqc report)\n\n\n3.2.5 VCF processing and PLINK transformation\nThe next computational steps were carried out with the programs bcftools (Li, 2011) and PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) in the command line using . Normalization, performed using bcftools norm, corrects for base misalignments and merges multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) into single entries, ensuring that variants are represented consistently across datasets. This process was executed on individual VCF files, which were then indexed for efficient access. Following normalization, the bcftools merge command was employed to merge all normalized VCF files into a single file. This merging step is crucial for subsequent analyses as it compiles all variant data into a unified dataset, facilitating easier manipulation and analysis. Subsequently, duplicate variants were removed using bcftools norm with the --rm-dup option, targeting both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions-deletions (indels). This removal is essential to prevent redundancy in variant representation, which can skew allele frequency calculations and other statistical analyses.\nThe final preprocessing step involved transforming the VCF file for compatibility with the PLINK toolset, a widely used software package for genome association studies. The plink command was utilized to convert VCF data into binary ped files while applying several filters: only SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 0.05 were retained, and variants with more than 30% missing genotyping information were excluded. Additionally, a stringent Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium threshold was set to minimize the inclusion of potentially erroneous genotypes. This transformation prepares the dataset for robust statistical analyses, allowing for the exploration of genetic associations and population structure with high reliability.\n\n\nCode\n\n#########################################\n### 1) Script to normalize and merge vcfs\n#########################################\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set the directory to search for VCF files\nVCF_DIR=$1\n\n# Check if directory is provided\nif [ -z \"$VCF_DIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/vcf_directory\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Create a temporary directory for normalized files\nTEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)\necho \"Temporary directory for normalized VCFs: $TEMP_DIR\"\n\n# Find all .vcf.gz files recursively in the directory\nVCF_FILES=$(find \"$VCF_DIR\" -name \"*.vcf.gz\")\n\n# Normalize each VCF file and index it\nfor INPUT_VCF in $VCF_FILES; do\n  OUTPUT_VCF=\"$TEMP_DIR/$(basename \"$INPUT_VCF\" .vcf.gz).norm.vcf.gz\"\n  echo \"Normalizing $INPUT_VCF to $OUTPUT_VCF\"\n  \n  # Normalize using bcftools\n  bcftools norm -m -both -o \"$OUTPUT_VCF\" -O z \"$INPUT_VCF\" --threads 8\n  \n  # Check if normalization was successful\n  if [ -s \"$OUTPUT_VCF\" ]; then\n    # Index the normalized VCF if it's not empty\n    tabix -p vcf \"$OUTPUT_VCF\"\n  else\n    echo \"Warning: Normalized VCF $OUTPUT_VCF is empty.\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n# List all normalized VCF files\nNORMALIZED_VCFS=$(find \"$TEMP_DIR\" -name \"*.norm.vcf.gz\")\n\n# Check if any normalized VCF files exist\nif [ -z \"$NORMALIZED_VCFS\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: No normalized VCF files found.

The .bim file contained 10,832,436 variants, of which 9,248,936 were successfully loaded, demonstrating a comprehensive coverage of the genetic data. During this process, missing variant identifiers were appropriately assigned.\nDespite this substantial data inclusion, the overall genotyping rate was notably low at 3.57% after removing 9,184,238 variants due to extensive missing genotype data. Furthermore, deviations observed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium resulted in the elimination of 4,504 variants through an exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An additional 11,342 variants were excluded based on minor allele frequency thresholds.\nAfter enforcing all quality control measures and variant filters, only 48,852 variants across 80 individuals remained, meeting the criteria for inclusion in further analyses.The significantly low genotyping rate observed could be attributed to the high number of SNPs unique to individual VCF files and not replicated across the cohort. This uniqueness might stem from intrinsic biological diversity or variations in sample processing techniques.",

There were no statistically significant differences across any of the variables assessed, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and liver fibrosis stages (Table 3.1). Median age distributions across the groups were 47, 51, and 51 years, respectively, with a p-value of 0.505, indicating uniform age distribution across the groups. Gender ratios were similarly consistent, comprising approximately 75% females and 25% males in each group, with a p-value of 0.913. BMI values, with medians of 49.2, 43.9, and 45.9 for the respective groups, also showed no significant variation (p=0.563). Even the categorization of liver fibrosis stages from F0 to F4 did not demonstrate significant differences across the groups (p=0.172), underscoring a lack of correlation between the variables studied and the percentage of liver fat.

GDS format is required for the SNPRelate package (Zheng et al., 2012) to 1) apply linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning to focus on significant SNPs and 2) use PCA to visualize the population structure. These processes revealed no distinct clustering by sex but some dispersion related to liver steatosis levels (Figure 3.2).\nThe PCA results indicated subtle genetic variability associated with liver steatosis, suggesting its potential to influence outcomes in the subsequent EWAS. Given this variability, we incorporated the principal components as covariates in EWAS to adjust for underlying population structure, thereby enhancing its robustness.

A Q-Q plot helps identify potential inflation caused by population stratification, cryptic relatedness, or other confounding factors. In our results, as shown in Figure 3.3, the Q-Q plot demonstrated that the observed χ2 values closely aligned with the expected values, indicated by a lambda (λ) close to 1.

Importantly, this model allows for the inclusion of one or more covariates— in this case, reported sex and the principal components — which serve as independent variables.

S100A7 may contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with obesity, while KIRREL3 could influence tissue integrity, impacting liver function. USP30 plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial quality, crucial for preventing fat accumulation in the liver, and SPNS3 is involved in sphingolipid transport, a process linked to metabolic disturbances in obesity.

WES offers significant advantages over array genotyping, including the ability to detect rare variants and novel mutations across the exome, providing a more comprehensive assessment of genetic variation. However, the study’s reduced sample size limits its statistical power, potentially overlooking associations that would be detectable in a larger cohort. While we did not identify significant associations with well-known genetic contributors to liver steatosis such as PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and GCKR, the novel SNPs identified in this study, particularly those related to SPNS3, could enhance polygenic risk scores and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the genetic architecture of steatosis.

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci associated with NAFLD, but these findings often have modest effect sizes and explain only a small portion of the heritability of NAFLD, which is estimated to be between 22–50% (Anstee et al., 2013). While polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting risk for complex traits (Trépo et al., 2020), their application to NAFLD has yet to yield robust results (Kawaguchi et al., 2018).\nTo enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of NAFLD, mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) provides a powerful approach. eQTL analysis links specific genetic variants with changes in gene expression, offering interpretable molecular connections between genetic variants and traits of interest (Albert et al., 2015; Yoo et al., 2021). This method significantly increases statistical power, allowing the detection of thousands of eQTLs even in relatively small sample sizes (Montgomery et al., 2010; Yoo et al., 2021).\nIn the context of obesity, where both adipose tissue and liver function are often compromised, integrating eQTL analysis within a multi-omic framework is essential. The goal of this study was to identify and characterize disease-specific eQTLs in patients with steatosis using gene expression in the liver and whole exome sequencing data. We aim to uncover novel genetic mechanisms underlying NAFLD and to improve the accuracy of genetic risk prediction for this complex disease.",

    "text": "4.2 Methods\nTranscriptome and genome data were obtained as detailed in Appendices 2 and 3, respectively. No genotype imputation was performed. These datasets were integrated for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping using R and MatrixEQTL (version 2.3) (Shabalin, 2012), with sex included as a covariate.\nTo identify steatosis-related eQTLs, the cohort was divided into two groups: no-steatosis (liver fat content &lt; 5%, n = 29) and steatosis (liver fat content &gt; 33%, n = 25). eQTL mapping was conducted separately within each group. eQTLs identified in both groups were excluded from further analysis to focus on steatosis-specific eQTLs.\nTo refine the list of steatosis-specific eQTLs, we selected the most significant SNP per gene, retaining only those eQTLs with an absolute β coefficient greater than 10. These eQTLs were further filtered by removing any SNPs that did not meet Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) criteria (HWE p-value &lt; 0.0001).\nA genome-wide association analysis was then performed between the identified SNPs and the dependent variable (steatosis) in the whole cohort using five different genetic models (inheritance patterns): codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive, utilizing the R package SNPassoc (version 2.1.0) (Moreno et al., 2022). For each eQTL, the model with the lowest p-value was selected for further analysis. Finally, the results were visualized by plotting the association data across three histologically defined steatosis groups (&lt;5%, 5-33%, and &gt;33%).

We identified 1191 genes with eQTLs (cis and trans) at FDR = 0.001, and 18220 significant SNPs. Among the eQTL-SNPs, 70.2% had an effect on multiple genes. This subset of eQTLs provides valuable insights into the specific genetic variants that may contribute to the development and progression of liver steatosis in obese individuals. The high proportion of SNPs affecting multiple genes underscores the complexity of the genetic regulation of liver gene expression in the context of steatosis.\n\n\n4.3.2 eQTLs in individuals without steatosis\n\n\nCode\n# Select RNAseq data for the non-steatosis subset\nexpression_healthy &lt;- counts  |&gt; \n  select(all_of(healthy))\n  \n\nsample_id_healthy &lt;- paste0(\"DNA_\",str_sub(names(expression_healthy),3,5),\"_\",\"DNA_\",str_sub(names(expression_healthy),3,5))\n\n# Extract genotype data from GDS file\ngeno_data &lt;- snpgdsGetGeno(genofile, sample.id=sample_id_healthy, snp.id=NULL, with.id=TRUE)\n\n# Extract the genotype matrix\ngeno_matrix &lt;- geno_data$genotype\n\n# Assign row and column names correctly\nrownames(geno_matrix) &lt;- geno_data$sample.id  # Row names: sample IDs\ncolnames(geno_matrix) &lt;- geno_data$snp.id     # Column names: SNP IDs\n\n# Reorder geno_matrix pheno with the same order than the expression matrix\ngeno_matrix &lt;- geno_matrix[sample_id_healthy,]\npheno_healthy &lt;- pheno[sample_id_healthy,]\ncolnames(expression_healthy) &lt;- sample_id_healthy\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define model (linear model with covariates, including treatment)\nmodel &lt;- modelLINEAR_CROSS\n\n# Prepare SNP, gene, and covariate data for MatrixEQTL\nSNP &lt;- SlicedData$new()\nSNP$CreateFromMatrix(as.matrix(t(geno_matrix)))\n\ngene &lt;- SlicedData$new()\ngene$CreateFromMatrix(as.matrix(expression_healthy))\n\ncvrt &lt;- SlicedData$new()\ncvrt$CreateFromMatrix(as.matrix(t(as.numeric(pheno_healthy$sex))))\n\n# Run the eQTL analysis\neqtl_results &lt;- Matrix_eQTL_main(\n  snps = SNP,\n  gene = gene,\n  cvrt = cvrt,\n  output_file_name = \"eqtl_results_healthy.txt\",\n  pvOutputThreshold = 1e-5,\n  useModel = model,\n  verbose = TRUE,\n  pvalue.hist = TRUE,\n  min.pv.by.genesnp = FALSE\n)\n\n# Check the results\n# summary(eqtl_results)\n# plot(eqtl_results)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load the eQTL results from the non-steatosis (healthy) data file\neqtl_healthy &lt;- read_delim(\"data/eqtl_results_healthy.txt\", delim = \"\\t\", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)\n\n# Filter the eQTL results to include only those with an FDR below the threshold and an absolute beta coefficient above the threshold\neqtl_top_healthy &lt;- eqtl_healthy |&gt; \n  filter(FDR &lt; fdr, abs(beta) &gt; b )\n\n# Group by SNP and count the number of distinct genes associated with each SNP\nt &lt;- eqtl_top_healthy |&gt; \n  group_by(SNP) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n_distinct(gene))\n\n# Calculate the percentage of SNPs that affect multiple genes\nmultiple &lt;- round(sum(t$n &gt; 1) / nrow(t) * 100, digits = 1)\n\n# Select the most significant SNP per gene, keeping only the SNP with the lowest FDR and highest absolute beta coefficient\neqtl_single_gene_healthy &lt;- eqtl_top_healthy |&gt; \n  group_by(SNP) |&gt; \n  arrange(FDR, desc(beta)) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  distinct(gene, .keep_all = TRUE)\n\n\nIn the non-steatosis subgroup, encompassed with 29 individuals with obesity , 14668 transcripts and 48852 SNPs were subject eQTL mapping. We identified 764 genes with eQTLs (cis and trans) at FDR = 0.001, and 14510 significant SNPs. Among the eQTL-SNPs, 56.2% had an effect on multiple genes.\nThis analysis allowed us to identify a significant number of eQTLs specific to individuals without steatosis, providing insights into the genetic regulation of liver gene expression in a healthier metabolic context. The lower proportion of SNPs affecting multiple genes compared to the steatosis group suggests potential differences in the genetic architecture underlying gene expression in individuals with and without liver steatosis.\n\n\n4.3.3 Identification of Steatosis-Specific eQTLs and Their Association with Steatosis Phenotypes\n\n\nCode\n# Identify SNPs that are unique to the steatosis group by finding the difference between the steatosis and healthy SNP sets\ndif &lt;- setdiff(eqtl_single_gene_steato$SNP, eqtl_single_gene_healthy$SNP)\n\n# Create a genotype-phenotype matrix for the liver samples, selecting only the SNPs unique to the steatosis group\nassoc_liver0 &lt;- geno_matrix_liver |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  select(all_of(dif)) |&gt; \n  mutate(steatosis_3cat = pheno_liver$steatosis_3cat, # Add the steatosis phenotype in three categories\n         steatosis = ifelse(steatosis_3cat == \"&gt;33%\", 1, 0), # Create a binary steatosis variable (&gt;33% = 1, otherwise = 0)\n         sex = pheno_liver$sexo, .before = 1) # Include sex as a covariate\n  \n# Set up the SNP data for association analysis, labeling genotypes as 0, 1, 2\nassoc_liver &lt;- setupSNP(assoc_liver0, colSNPs = 4:ncol(assoc_liver0), name.genotypes = c(0, 1, 2))\n\n# Filter SNPs that meet the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium criteria (HWE &gt;= 0.0001)\nok_liver &lt;- summary(assoc_liver, print = F) |&gt; \n  filter(HWE &gt;= 0.0001) \n\n# Prepare the final dataset for association analysis, selecting relevant variables and SNPs\nassoc_liver &lt;- assoc_liver |&gt; \n  select(steatosis_3cat, steatosis, sex, rownames(ok_liver))\n\n# Perform genome-wide association analysis using multiple genetic models and select the best model for each SNP\nset.seed(89)\nfinal0 &lt;- WGassociation(steatosis ~ sex, assoc_liver[, 1:ncol(assoc_liver)], mc.cores = 8)  \n\n# Process the association results to identify significant SNPs\nfinal &lt;- final0 |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(\"snp\") |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(codominant:`log-additive`, names_to = \"model\", values_to = \"pvalue\") |&gt; \n  group_by(snp) |&gt; \n  arrange(pvalue, .by_group = TRUE) |&gt; \n  distinct(snp, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(pvalue)) |&gt; \n  mutate(fdr = p.adjust(pvalue, method = \"fdr\")) |&gt; # Adjust p-values for multiple testing using FDR\n  filter(fdr &lt; 0.01) |&gt; \n  separate_wider_delim(snp, names = c(\"chr\", \"BP\"), delim = \".\", cols_remove = F) |&gt; \n  mutate(BP = as.integer (BP),\n         position = str_c(str_replace(chr, \"chr\", \"\"), BP, BP, sep = \":\"), # Format the SNP positions\n         snp = str_replace(snp, \"\\\\.\", \"\\\\:\"))\n\n\nTo identify steatosis-specific eQTLs, we first determined the SNPs that were unique to the steatosis group by comparing eQTLs identified in individuals with and without steatosis. This analysis revealed a set of 760 SNPs specific to the steatosis group.\nNext, we performed a genome-wide association analysis on these steatosis-specific SNPs using genotype data from the liver samples. The analysis included a binary steatosis phenotype, where individuals with liver fat content greater than 33% were classified as having steatosis. The association analysis was conducted using multiple genetic models (codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive), and for each SNP, the model with the lowest p-value was selected.\nTo ensure robustness, only SNPs that passed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium filter (HWE ≥ 0.0001) were included in the final analysis. After adjusting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method, we identified 5 significant SNPs associated with the steatosis phenotype at an FDR threshold of 0.01. These results highlight specific genetic variants that may play a critical role in the development and progression of steatosis, offering potential targets for further investigation in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\nThese SNPs were further annotated using biomaRt (Durinck et al., 2009) to map them to corresponding genes and reference SNP IDs. The final list of steatosis-specific eQTLs provided insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying steatosis in the liver, revealing potential candidate genes for further study.\nIn the analysis of eQTLs associated with liver steatosis, we observed significant differences in allele distribution across the three steatosis categories (&lt;5%, 5-33%, and &gt;33%) (Table 4.1). The alleles are coded as 0 for the major allele and 1 for the minor allele; no homozygous (2) minor allele carriers were found in our cohort, likely due to the small sample size.\n\n\nCode\n# eQTL´s target genes\ntarget0 &lt;- eqtl_single_gene_steato |&gt; \n  filter(SNP%in%final$snp) \n\ntarget &lt;- target0 |&gt; \n  group_by(SNP) |&gt; \n  summarize(target_genes = str_c(gene, collapse = \", \"),\n            beta = str_c(beta |&gt; round(digits = 0), collapse = \"/\"))\n\nfinal &lt;- final |&gt; \n  inner_join(target, by=c(\"snp\" =\"SNP\"))\n\n\n# Use biomaRt to retrieve additional SNP information, including gene associations\nensembl &lt;- biomaRt::useEnsembl(biomart = \"snps\", dataset = \"hsapiens_snp\")\nsnp_mart &lt;- biomaRt::getBM(\n  attributes = c('chrom_start','refsnp_id',\"ensembl_gene_stable_id\", 'chr_name', 'allele', \"allele_1\"),\n  filters = 'chromosomal_region', \n  values = final$position ,\n  mart = ensembl) |&gt; \n  distinct(chrom_start, .keep_all = T)\n\n# Map Ensembl gene IDs to gene symbols\ngene_symbol = mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = snp_mart$ensembl_gene_stable_id,\n               column = c(\"SYMBOL\"), keytype = \"ENSEMBL\")\n\n# Integrate SNP annotation with association results, including reference SNP IDs\nfinal &lt;- final |&gt; \n  left_join(snp_mart, by = c(\"BP\" = \"chrom_start\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(rfsnp = ifelse(is.na(refsnp_id), snp, refsnp_id))\n\n# Prepare the eQTL data for visualization and comparison across steatosis groups\neqtl &lt;- assoc_liver0 |&gt; \n  select(steatosis, steatosis_3cat, sex, final$snp) |&gt; \n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \\(x) as.character(x))) |&gt; \n  set_names(c(\"steatosis\", \"steatosis_3cat\", \"sex\", final$rfsnp))\n\neqtl_long &lt;-  eqtl |&gt;  \n  pivot_longer(4:ncol(eqtl), values_to = \"Allele\") |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(Allele))\n\n# Descriptive analysis and table generation\ncq &lt;- compareGroups(steatosis_3cat ~ . -steatosis - sex, data = eqtl)\ntq &lt;- createTable(cq, show.all = T)\nexport2md(tq, caption = \"\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Distribution (%) of the major (0) and minor (1) alleles associated with steatosis across different steatosis categories.p.overall: Chi square associated-p value for the comparison between steatosis categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ALL]\n&lt;5%\n5-33%\n&gt;33%\np.overall\n\n\n\n\n\nN=79\nN=29\nN=25\nN=25\n\n\n\nrs3127806:\n\n\n\n\n0.020\n\n\n0\n56 (82.4%)\n22 (95.7%)\n20 (87.0%)\n14 (63.6%)\n\n\n\n1\n12 (17.6%)\n1 (4.35%)\n3 (13.0%)\n8 (36.4%)\n\n\n\nrs326214:\n\n\n\n\n0.009\n\n\n0\n43 (58.1%)\n10 (37.0%)\n14 (60.9%)\n19 (79.2%)\n\n\n\n1\n31 (41.9%)\n17 (63.0%)\n9 (39.1%)\n5 (20.8%)\n\n\n\nrs937583:\n\n\n\n\n0.029\n\n\n0\n54 (68.4%)\n23 (79.3%)\n19 (76.0%)\n12 (48.0%)\n\n\n\n1\n25 (31.6%)\n6 (20.7%)\n6 (24.0%)\n13 (52.0%)\n\n\n\nchr3:9473234:\n\n\n\n\n0.024\n\n\n0\n42 (53.8%)\n13 (46.4%)\n10 (40.0%)\n19 (76.0%)\n\n\n\n1\n36 (46.2%)\n15 (53.6%)\n15 (60.0%)\n6 (24.0%)\n\n\n\nrs3739310:\n\n\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n0\n45 (62.5%)\n17 (60.7%)\n9 (40.9%)\n19 (86.4%)\n\n\n\n1\n27 (37.5%)\n11 (39.3%)\n13 (59.1%)\n3 (13.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn obese individuals with steatosis, eQTLs regulate gene expression by linking specific genetic variants (SNPs) to changes in expression levels. For instance, the minor allele (1) of the rs3127806 was found to be negatively associated with the expression of the PDZ and LIM domain 7 (PDLIM7) gene, which acts as a ubiquitin E3 ligase and inhibitor of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses (Jodo et al., 2020). PDLIM7 has also been implicated as a promoter of adipogenesis, linking it to obesity and fat storage processes(Fang et al., 2024).\nSimilarly, the minor allele of rs937583 was inversely associated with the expression of FNL2, a gene stimulated by hypoxia and linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma(Li et al., 2023). Another notable eQTL involved the variant chr3:9473234 , which was negatively associated with the expression of ETS2, a central regulator of inflammatory macrophages in the liver, further emphasizing its role in the inflammatory processes underlying NAFLD (Stankey et al., 2024).\nLastly, the minor allele of rs3739310 was positively associated with the expression of MSR1 (macrophage scavenger receptor 1), a gene linked to the occurrence of lipid-laden foamy macrophages in the liver. MSR1 expression correlates with the severity of steatosis and steatohepatitis in NAFLD patients(Govaere et al., 2022). These findings highlight the role of eQTLs in regulating gene expression relevant to liver fat accumulation and inflammation, suggesting potential molecular mechanisms that contribute to the progression of NAFLD.",

    "text": "4.4 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, our study identified significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with liver steatosis by leveraging whole exome sequencing and transcriptomic data from individuals with obesity. We observed that a substantial proportion of eQTL-SNPs have pleiotropic effects, influencing multiple genes, which underscores the complex genetic architecture underlying this condition. By distinguishing steatosis-specific eQTLs from those present in non-steatosis individuals, we have highlighted key genetic variants that may contribute to the pathogenesis of liver steatosis. These findings offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of steatosis and provide a foundation for future research aimed at developing targeted therapeutic interventions for steatosis non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n\n\n\nAlbert, F.
