    "text": "1.1.1 Types and Location of Adipose Tissue\nAT is integral to the human body, crucial in metabolic regulation, energy balance, and overall health [1]. AT comprises white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), each with distinct functions and cellular composition. WAT primarily stores energy, while BAT generates heat by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation [2]. Beige or brite AT can switch between energy storage and thermogenesis, depending on physiological demands. Cold exposure and exercise induce WAT beiging to increase thermogenesis, while heat stress absence or a high-fat diet inhibits this process [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Adipose tissue distribution in humans. White adipose tissue (WAT), represented in yellow, is primarily responsible for energy storage, while brown adipose tissue (BAT), in brown, is a thermogenic tissue.\n\n\n\nWAT, more abundant than BAT, varies in individual distribution due to genetic and environmental influences. It constitutes a significant proportion of total body weight, ranging from 5% to 60%. WAT is predominantly located in subcutaneous and visceral depots, with smaller amounts in bone marrow and muscle tissue [4]. Subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) contains over 80% of total body fat, while visceral WAT (visWAT) comprises 10–20% of total body fat in men and 5–10% in women [5].\nMetabolic differences between subcutaneous and visceral AT significantly affect overall health. scWAT is generally considered metabolically healthier than visWAT [6]. It efficiently stores lipids and has a lower association with metabolic diseases. In contrast, visWAT, found around internal organs, is metabolically active and releases fatty acids into the portal circulation, leading to insulin resistance and increased risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases [6].\n\n\n1.1.2 Composition and Cellular Types of White Adipose Tissue\nWAT comprises mainly mature adipocytes responsible for energy storage. Adipogenesis is how adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) differentiate into adipocytes, maintaining adipocyte populations and contributing to the tissue’s regenerative capacity [7].\nWAT also includes various non-adipocyte cells, such as endothelial cells, blood cells, neurons, fibroblast, pericytes,and immune cells, contributing to its functionality in metabolic processes.These non-adipocyte cells perform physiological and pathophysiological functions, interacting with adipocytes through secreted factors.Their diversity and number vary with obesity and metabolic dysfunction development [8].",

    "text": "1.2 Metabolic Functions of Adipose Tissue\nThe primary function of WAT is to regulate energy balance by storing and releasing fatty acids (FAs) in response to changes in energy availability. However, WAT also secretes various hormones and cytokines, known as adipokines, that play essential roles in regulating multiple physiological processes [9].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Functions of white adipose tissue (WAT). WAT regulates energy balance by storing (lipogenesis) and releasing (lipolysis) non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). WAT also secretes a variety of molecules that play essential roles in the regulation of multiple physiological processes. Abbreviation: ACC, acetyl CoA-carboxylase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; CCL2, CC-chemokin-ligand-2; DGAT, diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferasen; FAS, fatty acid synthase; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; IL-8, interleukin 8; IL-10, interleukin 10; IMGL, monoacylglycerol lipase; TG, triglyceride; and TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Lipids Storage and Mobilization\nWAT regulates energy balance through storing and releasing FAs, governed by the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis. This balance is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis during fasting or exercise.\nLipogenesis synthesizes new lipids from excess glucose or dietary FAs.This process, occurring in adipocyte cytoplasm, is tightly regulated by hormones and enzymes. Insulin, the primary hormone regulating this process, promotes glucose and FA uptake into adipocytes and stimulates key enzymes in lipid synthesis, such as acetyl CoA-carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) [10].\nLipolysis breaks down stored lipids in AT to release energy for peripheral organs. It is critical during fasting or exercise when glucose levels are low, and the body relies on stored fat for energy. Lipolysis is regulated by lipases, activated by sympathetic nervous system signals mediated mainly by norepinephrine but also by epinephrine. The main lipases are adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) [11].\n\n\n1.2.2 Endocrine Function\nWAT acts as an endocrine organ, secreting adipokines that regulate metabolic, inflammatory, and immune processes throughout the body. The endocrine function of WAT is regulated by nutritional status, physical activity, hormonal levels, and environmental cues, closely linked to its metabolic and storage functions [12].\nAdipokines include over 100 proteins that communicate with other cells and tissues. Leptin and adiponectin are the most abundant and well-characterized adipokines. Leptin regulates appetite and energy expenditure, providing feedback to the brain about AT size and status [13]. Adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity and FA oxidation in skeletal muscle and liver, helping maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis [14]. Pro-inflammatory factors like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 18 (IL-18), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) are also produced by WAT and increased in obesity [15].",

    "text": "1.3 Adipose Tissue Dysfunction in Obesity\n\n1.3.1 Adipose Tissue expandability\nThe adipose tissue expandability hypothesis is central to understanding obesity-related comorbidities, including MASLD. This hypothesis suggests that the body’s ability to store excess calories in scWAT is limited and varies among individuals . When scWAT reaches its maximal storage capacity, AT can no longer store lipids effectively, leading to lipid redirection to other organs [16]. This causes ectopic fat accumulation, mainly in visWAT and the liver, resulting in insulin resistance and related metabolic complications through lipotoxic and inflammation-driven mechanisms [17].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Adipose tissue expansion during obesity. AT, adipose tissue; scWAT, subcutaneous white adipose tissue; visWAT, visceral white adipose tissue\n\n\n\nVisceral WAT expansion leads to adipocyte hypertrophy (increased adipocyte size) and hyperplasia (new adipocyte formation from precursor differentiation), contributing to tissue dysfunction [18]. As adipocytes expand, they experience mechanical stress, increased contact with neighboring cells and extracellular matrix components, and hypoxia due to insufficient angiogenesis. Hypertrophic adipocytes and damaged cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, attracting and activating immune cells, promoting chronic low-grade inflammation that severely alters AT functionality [6].",

    "text": "1.4 Adipose Tissue Expandability and Liver Fat Deposition\n\n1.4.1 Connection between AT Expandability and MASLD\nThe imbalance between energy intake and AT’s storage capacity is crucial in MASLD development. Excessive caloric intake, especially when scWAT expandability is limited, leads to hepatic fat deposition. This hepatic fat accumulation, or steatosis, is MASLD’s hallmark and sets the stage for further liver damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Adipose tissue—liver cross-talk in the progression of NAFLD/NASH associated with obesity. AT, adipose tissue; FFA, free fatty acids; MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease; and MASH, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.\n\n\n\nMASLD, formerly known as Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a progressive liver disease characterized by the build-up of fat in the liver of individuals with little or no alcohol intake. While diagnosing NAFLD mainly involved excluding significant or excessive alcohol consumption, MASLD include metabolic risk factors in their diagnostic criteria [19].\n\n\n1.4.2 Hepatic Response to Ectopic Fat Accumulation\nIn MASLD, hepatocytes are the primary cells affected by ectopic fat deposition.The accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes, initially a protective response to excess circulating free fatty acids, leads to cellular stress and damage (Figure 4).This stress manifests in several ways:\n\nLipotoxicity: Elevated lipid levels, especially saturated fatty acids and toxic lipid species like diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide, induce lipotoxic stress in hepatocytes, causing dysfunction and apoptosis [20].\nInflammatory Response: Ectopic liver fat triggers an inflammatory response, drawing immune cells and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation results in significant histological changes, such as hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, neutrophil chemotaxis, activation of hepatic stellate cells, and Mallory body production. This inflammation is crucial in the disease’s progression from steatosis to MASH (Metabolic Associated SteatoHepatitis) and fibrosis, and may promote carcinogenesis, leading to hepatocarcinoma (HCC) [21].\nOxidative Stress: When lipid overflow surpasses the capacities of mitochondria and peroxisomes, respiratory oxidation is impaired, leading to the production of harmful metabolites and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) [22]. These molecules induce oxidative stress, which aggravates hepatic necro-inflammatory processes and damages mitochondria. ROS and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) activate Kupffer and hepatic stellate cells, resulting in collagen deposition and secondary liver fibrosis [23].\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress: Accumulated lipids disrupt ER function in hepatocytes, initiating an unfolded protein response and further contributing to cellular stress and apoptosis [24].\nAltered Metabolism: Hepatocytes in a fatty liver display altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, often associated with insulin resistance. This exacerbates lipid accumulation and impairs liver function [25].\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Liver biopsy for the diagnosis and assesment of NAFLD\nLiver biopsy remains the gold standard for gaining insights into the architectural distortion and complex anatomical relationships among cellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Histological evaluation of MASLD aims to achieve three main goals: to diagnose the disease, grade necroinflammatory activity, and stage the severity of fibrosis [26].\nFibrosis stage is the most reliable long-term outcome predictor in multivariable analyses, while ballooning injury and portal inflammation serve as short-term predictors of fibrosis progression or regression. These are frequently used together as measures of disease grade. Composite histological scores, such as the NAFLD activity score (NAS), integrate these features and are employed in clinical studies to provide a structured overall assessment of disease severity. Specifically, the NAS is defined as the unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3), and ballooning (0-2); thus ranging from 0 to 8. Fibrosis, which is both less reversible and generally thought to be a result of disease activity, is not included as a component of the activity score [27].",

    "text": "1.5 Diagnostic Approaches and Biomarkers for Adipose Tissue Dysfunction\nThe rising global prevalence of obesity presents a significant public health challenge, given its association with numerous diseases. Accurate diagnosis is essential for preventing, detecting, and managing obesity to mitigate its health and economic impacts. Various diagnostic approaches have been proposed to classify obesity phenotypes and anticipate metabolic complications.\n\n1.5.1 Anthropometric Parameters\nAnthropometric parameters are widely used for diagnosing obesity and its metabolic complications due to their non-invasive and cost-effective nature.The body mass index (BMI) is the most common method to estimate body fat [28]. However, since BMI cannot detect regional variations in fat deposition, other measures like waist circumference (WC) or waist/hip ratio (WHR, waist circumference divided by hip circumference) are also used [29]. However, these parameters do not differentiate regarding the contribution of subcutaneous or visceral fat either.\n\n\n1.5.2 Imaging Techniques for Adipose Tissue Analysis\nAdvanced imaging techniques have significantly enhanced the diagnosis and understanding of obesity, particularly in assessing adipose tissue (AT) distribution [30]. Techniques such as Bioimpedance Analysis (BIA), which uses electrical signals to estimate body composition, are non-invasive and widely accessible, making them a standard tool for initial body composition assessments [31]. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) offers detailed analysis of body composition, distinguishing between bone, lean, and fat mass, and is particularly effective for evaluating bone density and fat distribution [30]. Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are considered the gold standard for quantitatively evaluating intra-abdominal AT distribution [30].\nThese methods allow for precise differentiation between subcutaneous and visceral fat depots, providing detailed images of fat distribution that are crucial for understanding the relationships between fat compartments and metabolic health. The ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat (sc/vis ratio), determined through CT or MRI, is a critical indicator of metabolic health, with a higher proportion of visceral fat associated with greater risks of metabolic syndromes, including insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [32].\n\n\n1.5.3 Clasical Circulating Biomarkers\nIdentifying circulating biomarkers reflecting underlying biological mechanisms for increased disease risk is an alternative approach to characterize relevant obesity phenotypes. Several circulating molecules have been identified as obesity-associated biomarkers, classified into adipokines, markers of the glucose-insulin pathway, and inflammatory markers. Adipokines like leptin and adiponectin are critical, with leptin levels associated with obesity complications and hypertension [33], while adiponectin levels inversely correlate with obesity and related diseases such as IR, T2DM, and CVD [34, 35]. Other adipokines like FABP-4 and visfatin are linked to chronic diseases but are less understood [36]. Glucose-insulin pathway markers, including fasting insulin and IGF-1, correlate with obesity severity and diabetes risk [37, 38]. Inflammatory markers like CRP are elevated in obesity, indicating systemic inflammation and increasing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases [39].\n\n\n1.5.4 Omics-Based Biomarkers\nOmics approaches integrate data to uncover molecular patterns linked with obesity. Research in genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics has identified genes, RNA, and metabolites linked to obesity. Novel omic-based biomarkers include epigenomics, proteomics, glycomics, and microbiomics.\n\n1.5.4.1 Genomics\nGenetic susceptibility to obesity is determined by multiple genetic variants [40, 41]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify critical genetic variants in obesity that may serve as biomarkers [42]. A recent GWAS identified 941 near-independent SNPs associated with BMI [43]. Fewer variants have been linked to body fat distribution. A meta-analysis identified and replicated 49 loci [44]. The FTO gene is the strongest and most replicated, with variants linked to appetite regulation [45], adipocyte browning and energy expenditure [46], or circadian rhythm [47], and chronic diseases, including cancers [48], among others.\n\n\n1.5.4.2 Transcriptomics\nAdipocyte transcriptomes from both subcutaneous and visceral WAT reveal genes with altered expression in obese versus lean individuals and genes correlated with metabolic complications [49] and particularly fatty liver disease [50]. Recent advancements in single-cell transcriptomics offer insights into adipose tissue heterogeneity and dynamics, identifying gene signatures associated with adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and adipokine secretion [51, 52]. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as miRNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), are also promising biomarkers in obesity, with important regulatory roles in adipocytes and detectable in the bloodstream as circulating miRNAs (cmiRNAs) [53].\n\n\n1.5.4.3 Metabolomics\nAlterations in many metabolites are associated with obesity, including higher plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA), and lower glycine levels [54]. These biomarkers are linked to IR and higher T2DM risk [55, 56]. Lipidomics, a metabolomics branch, reveals plasma lipids as mediators of metabolic dysfunction and obesity-related diseases [57]. Lipid profile analysis has been fundamental in assessing dyslipidemia [58]. A recent review showed a variable decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids and non-esterified fatty acids in fatty liver disease patients, both in plasma and liver [59].",

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nRecent advancements in omics technologies and the decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) have transformed high-throughput data generation and analysis. Companies like Novogene and BGI, which specialize in outsourcing, have played a key role in this shift. As these technologies evolve, the large volumes of data produced daily require advanced and customizable analytical methods.\nThere are two main types of analysis tools: graphical user interface (GUI) tools and command line interface (CLI) tools. GUI tools are user-friendly and accessible to researchers without advanced programming skills, offering robust capabilities for omics data analysis. These tools can be either web-based or local applications. Web-based applications, such as Galaxy or Partek Flow, are frequently updated and provide access to the latest database versions. However, they may be less stable compared to local applications, which are more reliable for reproducible results.\nCLI tools, on the other hand, require bioinformatics expertise but offer greater flexibility and powerful features for customizing and automating complex analyses. Programs written in Bash, R, Python, Perl, and Groovy are particularly efficient for high-throughput data processing, especially in parallel computing environments. The open-source nature of R and Python, along with their extensive libraries and packages, has made them widely adopted in bioinformatics.\nSpecialized tools for pipeline development, such as Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, and Cromwell, have enhanced the scalability and reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows. Nextflow stands out for its ability to adapt pipelines written in various scripting languages and for its active user community that maintains and shares curated nf-core pipelines.\nIn RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data analysis, a typical pipeline involves several stages: upstream data processing, quality control, visualization of count matrices, and downstream functional analysis. Different tools excel at various stages, and integrating these tools can create a more comprehensive and customized analytical approach. This project leverages the strengths of Nextflow’s nf-core rnaseq pipeline and the versatility of R and its packages to develop a robust and flexible RNA-seq data analysis pipeline.\nhttps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.15.562329v3.full",

    "text": "2.2 Experimental design\n\n2.2.1 RNA isolation and extraction\nTotal RNA was isolated from paired frozen biopsies of scWAT (n=80) and liver (n=80) by homogenizing the tissues in 1 ml of TRIzol per sample (Sigma Aldrich, #T9424) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The homogenates were transferred to a vial and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature to dissociate nuclear components. Next, 0.2 ml of 100% chloroform per ml of TRIzol was added, shaken vigorously, incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, three phases were formed. The aqueous phase containing the RNA was isolated, and 0.5 ml of 100% isopropanol was added to precipitate the RNA. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 minutes and centrifuged again at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by decanting, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 75% ethanol for washing. The pellet was homogenized, centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was then dried for 5 minutes at room temperature before resuspending the RNA in DEPC water. To remove any genomic DNA, the RNA samples were treated with RNase-Free DNase (Life Technologies). The concentration and purity of the RNA were measured by absorbance at 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm using a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher).\n\n\n2.2.2 RNA quality assessment\n\n\nCode\n##### RIN numbers\nrin &lt;- read_csv(\"data/rin.csv\")\n\n# histogram decoration\ngg_hist &lt;- function(){list(\n  geom_histogram(bins = 7, fill=\"darkgrey\"),\n        labs(x=\"RIN\",y=\"Number of Samples\\n\"),\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = 4:10, limits = c(4,10)),\n        theme_minimal(),\n        theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.title = element_text(size=15),\n          axis.text = element_text(size=12))\n)} \n\nr1 &lt;- ggplot(rin |&gt; filter (tissue==\"liver\"), aes(RIN_SCT))+\n        gg_hist()\n        \n\nr2 &lt;- ggplot(rin |&gt; filter (tissue==\"scWAT\"), aes(RIN_SCT))+\n        gg_hist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Histograms representing the distribution of RIN numbers across samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA integrity was assessed using the RNA integrity number (RIN). The RIN was measured with the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and the RNA ScreenTape assay, following the manufacturer’s protocol. For liver tissue samples, the average RIN was 6.8 ± 1.0, with values ranging from 4.8 to 8.9. In contrast, scWAT samples showed higher RNA integrity, with an average RIN of 8.1 ± 0.6, ranging from 6.3 to 9.0. The higher RIN values in scWAT suggest better RNA preservation, likely due to lower enzymatic activity that degrades RNA (Figure 2.1).\n\n\n2.2.3 Stranded mRNA library construction, quality control and sequencing\nThe preparation of RNA libraries and sequencing was performed at the Novogene Cambridge Science Park (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Libraries were prepared using the Novogene NGS RNA Library Prep Set (PT042). Briefly, mRNA obtained with poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads was fragmented and the first strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers. Then, the second strand cDNA was synthesized using dUTP, instead of dTTP. The directional library was ready after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, enzyme digestion to remove UTP-containing second strand cDNA, size selection, PCR amplification, and purification.\nLibraries were checked with Qubit and real-time PCR for quantification and bioanalyzer for size distribution detection. Five libraries (1 from liver and 4 from scWAT) did not meet the quality standards and were not sequenced. Libraries that passed quality controls were pooled and sequenced (2 x 150 bp) on Novaseq X Plus (Illumina), according to the effective library concentration and data amount.\n\n\n2.2.4 mRNAseq mapping and quantification workflow\nWe used the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline with Nextflow (version 23.10.1) to process RNA sequencing data (compressed fastq files). The analysis was containerized using Docker to ensure reproducibility. Input data, including sample metadata, was provided via a CSV file, and the workflow was performed by the Biocomputation Core on the Core Cluster of the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud. We employed the STAR aligner with Salmon for quantification, using the GRCh38.p13 reference genome and Gencode v40 gene annotations. The pipeline was configured to skip marking duplicate reads and using custom genome references rather than default settings. The workflow was based on the nf-core repository at .\n\n\n2.2.5 Quality control and reads preprocessing\nIn our study, the initial analysis of raw sequencing data from RNAseq experiments involving liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) showed similar average (mean ± sd) outputs before trimming, with liver samples yielding 50.4 ± 10 million reads per sample (forward + reverse) and scWAT 52.1 ± 11 million reads. The variability in sequencing depth between samples was evidenced by ranges extending from 31.0 to 85.3 million reads per sample for liver, and 20.3 to 83.0 million reads for scWAT. (Multiqc report)\nPost-sequencing data processing with Cutadapt revealed a mean trimming percentage of 1.02 ± 0.19% for liver samples and 1.41 ± 0.44% for SCWAT, suggesting a higher incidence of adapter contamination or low-quality bases in SCWAT samples.\nMapping efficiencies, assessed using STAR, demonstrated robust alignment with an average of 89.6 ± 2.9% of sequences uniquely mapping to the reference genome (GRCh38) for liver samples, and a similar mapping performance 90.2 ± 1.64% for scWAT. Reads mapping to multiple loci were also similar between tissues, with 8.18 ± 1.59% for liver and 8.45 ± 1.46% for scWAT.",

    "text": "2.3 Gene expression analysis according to steatosis using DESeq2\nThe analysis began by loading essential R packages: tidyverse [1]for data manipulation, DESeq2 [2] for differential expression analysis, and org.Hs.eg.db [3] for gene annotation. Metadata were imported, and sample identifiers were established as row names. Steatosis was recategorized into three distinct groups. Gene count data were subsequently loaded, and values were rounded to the nearest integer. To enhance the robustness of the analysis, we performed a pre-filtering step to keep only those genes that had a count &gt; 15 in at least 30 samples (out of 155). Counts of the autosomal regions (PAR) were added to their homologous sequence. Gene identifiers initially provided in ENSEMBL format were converted to HGNC symbols via a mapping process that involved the creation of a dictionary through joins between the ensembl and symbol tables, linking ENSEMBL IDs to their respective HGNC counterparts. This conversion facilitated the utilization of more standardized and widely recognized gene names in subsequent analytical processes.\n\n\nCode\n###########################################\n# Read metadata ########################### \n###########################################\n \nmeta_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/20240813_metadata.csv\") |&gt; \n  # set the 'prefix' column as row names\n  column_to_rownames(\"prefix\") |&gt; \n  # recode steatosis categories into a new variable with only 3 levels\n  mutate(steatosis_3cat=fct_recode(Steatosis,`&gt;33%`=\"&gt;33-66%\",`&gt;33%`=\"&gt;66%\"),\n         steatosis_3cat=factor(steatosis_3cat,levels=c(\"&lt;5%\", \"5-33%\", \"&gt;33%\")))\n\n\n\n\n##########################################\n# Read count data #######################\n###########################################\n\ncounts0 &lt;- read.delim(\"data/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv\")\n\n\nfilter &lt;- rowSums(counts0 &gt;= 30) &gt;= 30\ncounts_filtered &lt;- counts0[filter,] |&gt; \n  round(digits = 0)\n\n#########################################################\n# Map ENSEMBL gene IDs to HGNC symbols for compatibility with gene annotations\nsymb &lt;- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = str_sub(rownames(counts_filtered),1,15),\n               column = c(\"SYMBOL\"), keytype = \"ENSEMBL\")\n\n# filter out untranslated genes\ncounts_na &lt;- counts_filtered |&gt; \n  mutate(symbol = symb, .before = 1) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(symbol)) \n\n# sum the counts of duplicated genes (normaly pseudogenes)\ncounts &lt;- counts_na |&gt; \n  group_by(symbol) |&gt; \n  mutate(across(everything(), \\(x) sum(x))) |&gt; \n  distinct(symbol,.keep_all = T) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"symbol\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create DESeqDataSet for scWAT data\n# - Select columns from the counts matrix that start with \"SC_\" (scWAT samples)\n# - Filter the metadata to include only scWAT samples\n# - Specify the design formula to include gender (sexo) and steatosis categories (steatosis_3cat)\n# - Indicate that the countData is not in tidy format (rows are genes, columns are samples)\ndds_sc &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts |&gt; select(starts_with(\"SC_\")),\n  colData = meta_data |&gt; filter(tissue == \"scWAT\"),\n  design = ~ sexo + steatosis_3cat,\n  tidy = FALSE\n)\n\n# Apply variance stabilizing transformation (VST) to scWAT data\n# - Perform VST on the scWAT dataset without blinding to the experimental design\nvst_sc &lt;- vst(dds_sc, blind = FALSE)\n\n# Create DESeqDataSet for liver data\n# - Select columns from the counts matrix that start with \"L_\" (liver samples)\n# - Filter the metadata to include only liver samples\n# - Specify the design formula to include gender (sexo) and steatosis categories (steatosis_3cat)\ndds_liver &lt;- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(\n  countData = counts |&gt; select(starts_with(\"L_\")),\n  colData = meta_data |&gt; filter(tissue == \"liver\"),\n  design = ~ sexo + steatosis_3cat\n)\n\n# Apply variance stabilizing transformation (VST) to liver data\n# - Perform VST on the liver dataset without blinding to the experimental design\nvst_liver &lt;- vst(dds_liver, blind = FALSE)\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Data quality assessment\nData quality assessment and quality control are pivotal initial steps in any RNAseq analysis, particularly aimed at ensuring the fitness of data for detecting differentially expressed genes. These procedures are designed to identify and exclude samples and or data points compromised by experimental anomalies, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the analysis.\nBoxplots in Figure 2.2 display log2-transformed raw counts grouped by tissue and steatosis severity levels. The data across steatosis categories (“&lt;5%”, “5-33%”, “&gt;33%”) are visualized with varying colors (gree, orange, and red) to highlight differences in expression profiles. In both scWAT and liver all samples showed similar dispersion and central tendencies in gene expression counts. The uniformity in distribution across all steatosis levels suggested that library depth and average counts per sample were consistent, precluding any library bias in the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n########## scWAT ##############################################################\n###############################################################################\n\n# Extract counts data from DESeq2 object for scWAT and convert to a data frame\n# Access raw counts data from the DESeq2 object (dds_sc)\ncounts_sc &lt;- dds_sc@assays@data$counts |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  # Move gene names into a column named \"gene\"\n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data from wide to long format with gene, sample, and counts columns\n  pivot_longer(-\"gene\", names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"counts\") |&gt; \n  # Join the counts data with metadata to add sample information\n  inner_join(meta_data |&gt; rownames_to_column(\"prefix\"), by = c(\"sample\" = \"prefix\")) |&gt; \n  # Ensure sample names are treated as characters\n  mutate(sample.y = as.character(sample.y))\n\n# Function for boxplot decoration\ngg_box &lt;- function() {\n  list(\n    # Add a boxplot geometry, remove missing values (na.rm = TRUE)\n    geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE),\n    # Apply a log2 transformation to the y-axis\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\"),\n    # Add labels for the x and y axes\n    labs(x = \"\\nSample\", y = \"Raw counts\"),\n    # Set custom fill colors for steatosis categories\n    scale_fill_manual(\"Steatosis\", values = c(\"#99c140\", \"#e7b416\", \"#db7b2b\")),\n    # Flip the coordinates to make the boxplots horizontal\n    coord_flip(),\n    # Apply a minimal theme for a clean appearance\n    theme_minimal(),\n    # Adjust the size of the axis titles\n    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 14))\n  )\n}\n\n# Boxplot visualizing the log-transformed read counts across samples grouped by steatosis categories\np1 &lt;- ggplot(counts_sc, aes(x = reorder(sample.y, as.numeric(steatosis_3cat)),\n                            # Add 1 to counts for log transformation, and fill by steatosis category\n                            y = counts + 1, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n      # Apply the gg_box function for consistent styling\n      gg_box()\n\n\n########## liver ##############################################################\n\n# Extract counts data from DESeq2 object for liver and convert to a data frame\n# Access raw counts data from the DESeq2 object (dds_liver)\ncounts_liver &lt;- dds_liver@assays@data$counts |&gt; \n  as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  # Move gene names into a column named \"gene\"\n  rownames_to_column(\"gene\") |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data from wide to long format with gene, sample, and counts columns\n  pivot_longer(-\"gene\", names_to = \"sample\", values_to = \"counts\") |&gt; \n  # Join the counts data with metadata to add sample information\n  inner_join(meta_data |&gt; rownames_to_column(\"prefix\"), by = c(\"sample\" = \"prefix\")) |&gt; \n  # Ensure sample names are treated as characters\n  mutate(sample.y = as.character(sample.y))\n\n# Boxplot visualizing the log-transformed read counts across samples grouped by steatosis categories\np2 &lt;- ggplot(counts_liver, aes(x = reorder(sample.y, as.numeric(steatosis_3cat)),\n                               # Add 1 to counts for log transformation, and fill by steatosis category\n                               y = counts + 1, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n      # Apply the gg_box function for consistence\n      gg_box()\n\n# Combine the two boxplots (scWAT and liver) into a single figure with labeled panels\nplot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c('a', 'b'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Boxplots representing the distribution of log2-transformed read counts across samples (a: scWAT, b: liver), with distinct coloration representing different steatosis categories.

Initially, we configured the DESeq2 object using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) method, suitable for handling complex comparisons involving multiple levels of a factor.\n\n\nCode\n# Perform differential expression analysis for scWAT data\n# Run DESeq2 using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) controlling for the effect of gender (sexo)\ndex_sc &lt;- DESeq(dds_sc, test = \"LRT\", reduced = ~ sexo)    \n\n\nUnder the hood of the DESeq function the normalization of count data was performed using the median of ratios method, ensuring that variations in library size did not bias the analysis. This method adjusted each sample’s read counts by a size factor, calculated to equalize the median of ratios across all samples (Figure 2.4).\n\n\nCode\n## Extract and visualize size factors from the DESeq2 object\nsizeFactors(dex_sc) |&gt; as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(\"Sample\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::rename(`Size Factors`= \"sizeFactors(dex_sc)\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Sample = str_sub (Sample, 4,6)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Sample, y= `Size Factors`))+\n  geom_col(col=\"darkgrey\", fill = \"grey\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Calculated factor sizes for each sample using the median of ratios method.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address the intrinsic variability in count data, DESeq2 estimates gene-wise dispersion, which reflects the variance deviation from the mean for each gene. This step is crucial because RNA-seq data typically exhibit variance that exceeds the mean, particularly when expression levels are low. Dispersion parameters were calculated for each gene (Black dots in Figure 2.5), taking into account the mean expression levels and observed variance.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate a plot of dispersion estimates using the DESeq2 object\nd2 &lt;- plotDispEsts(dex_sc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Dispersion plot. Black dots represents single genes and the intial maximum likelihood dispersion estimate (MLE) given the observed data, the red line is the fitted curve to gene-wise dispersion estimates, while blue dots are the shrunken gene-wise dispersion estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gene-wise dispersions were then modeled through a curve-fitting process, to generalize dispersion behavior across the dataset. The curve, represented in red in Figure 2.5, illustrates the inverse relationship between mean expression and dispersion, a typical observation in RNA-seq data. The final analytical step involved shrinking the initial raw dispersion estimates towards the values predicted by the fitted curve (Blue dots).\nOur analysis revealed a pattern where dispersion generally decreased with increasing mean expression levels, indicating a stable and consistent data quality across our sample set. The limited shrinkage observed was attributable to the large number of biological replicates, which provided a robust basis for the dispersion estimates.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Testing for differential expression\n\n\nCode\n# Use DESeq2 to extract results from the differential expression analysis with FDR adjustment\nres_sc &lt;- results(dex_sc, pAdjustMethod = \"fdr\", independentFiltering = TRUE)\n\n# Convert the results to a data frame for easier manipulation\nres_sc_df &lt;- res_sc |&gt; \n  as.data.frame()\n\n# Filter the results to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\n# Keep only those genes with an adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05\ndegs_sc &lt;- res_sc_df |&gt; \n  filter(padj &lt; 0.05)\n\n# Count the number of upregulated genes (log2FoldChange &gt; 0)\nup &lt;- sum(res_sc_df$log2FoldChange &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Count the number of downregulated genes (log2FoldChange &lt; 0)\ndown &lt;- sum(res_sc_df$log2FoldChange &lt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nIn our differential expression analysis using DESeq2 with the LRT model, we initially identified 9849 genes as upregulated and 4682 as downregulated in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) of individuals with the highest steatosis compared to those with no steatosis. However, after applying a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of less than 0.05, the number of statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was greatly reduced to 20. Of these, only 2 genes were found to be upregulated, while 18 were downregulated (Table 2.1)\n\n\nCode\n# Select relevant columns from the significant DEGs in scWAT data\ndegs_sc |&gt; \n  # Select the log2 fold change, p-value, and adjusted p-value (FDR)\n  select(log2FoldChange, pvalue, fdr = \"padj\") |&gt; \n  # Arrange the results by the FDR (adjusted p-value) in ascending order\n  arrange(fdr) |&gt; \n  # Create a formatted table with specified number of digits for each column\n  kbl(digits = c(2, 5, 3)) |&gt; \n  # Apply striped styling to the table for better visual presentation\n  kable_styling(\"striped\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT. fdr: false discovery rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog2FoldChange\npvalue\nfdr\n\n\n\n\nHOOK3\n-1.41\n0.00000\n0.000\n\n\nZNF429\n-1.07\n0.00000\n0.002\n\n\nUSHBP1\n-0.78\n0.00000\n0.010\n\n\nPOLRMT\n-0.40\n0.00002\n0.027\n\n\nCETP\n-1.09\n0.00002\n0.027\n\n\nZNF500\n-0.63\n0.00002\n0.027\n\n\nPEX6\n-0.57\n0.00003\n0.027\n\n\nPDE11A\n-1.04\n0.00003\n0.027\n\n\nOSER1-DT\n-1.00\n0.00002\n0.027\n\n\nABHD18\n-0.66\n0.00003\n0.027\n\n\nSEMA3C\n0.61\n0.00002\n0.027\n\n\nLYRM7\n-0.94\n0.00001\n0.027\n\n\nDCLRE1C\n-0.58\n0.00003\n0.027\n\n\nWDR73\n-0.75\n0.00004\n0.030\n\n\nINTS7\n0.72\n0.00005\n0.035\n\n\nNAT8L\n-0.60\n0.00008\n0.047\n\n\nSAC3D1\n-0.67\n0.00007\n0.047\n\n\nGATD1-DT\n-0.83\n0.00008\n0.047\n\n\nINTS1\n-0.62\n0.00008\n0.047\n\n\nCCDC61\n-0.62\n0.00009\n0.050\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this regard, the volcano plot (Figure 2.6) illustrates the differential expression of genes in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) according to liver steatosis. Among the thousands of genes analyzed, those genes displayed in red showed both statistically significant p-values (FDR &lt; 0.05) and substantial changes in expression (Log2 FC &gt; 1).\n\n\nCode\n# Create a volcano plot for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT\nEnhancedVolcano(res_sc,\n    # Label the points on the plot with gene names from the rownames of res_sc\n    lab = rownames(res_sc),\n    # Set the main title of the plot\n    title = \"Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT\",\n    # Set the subtitle indicating the comparison groups\n    subtitle = \"&gt;33%  vs. &lt;5% steatosis\",\n    # Customize the legend labels for different categories of DEGs\n    legendLabels = c(\"NS\", expression(Log[2] ~ FC  &gt; 1), \"FDR &lt; 0.05\", expression( FDR &lt; 0.05 ~ and ~ Log[2] ~ FC  &gt; 1)),\n    # Set the caption below the plot (empty in this case)\n    caption = \"\",\n    # Set the size of the labels on the plot\n    labSize = 4,\n    # Position the legend to the right of the plot\n    legendPosition = 'right',\n    # Draw lines connecting labels to their corresponding points\n    drawConnectors = TRUE,\n    # Connect labels to points in both directions (from left and right)\n    directionConnectors = \"both\",\n    # Allow for an infinite number of overlapping points to be labeled\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    # Set the fold change cutoff for highlighting DEGs\n    FCcutoff = 1,\n    # Specify the column to use for the p-value cutoff\n    pCutoffCol = \"padj\",\n    # Set the p-value cutoff for significance\n    pCutoff = 0.05,\n    # Set the x-axis to represent log2 fold change\n    x = 'log2FoldChange',\n    # Set the y-axis to represent the p-value\n    y = 'pvalue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Volcano plot showing DEGs (in red) in individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing their identification, we further analyzed the expression patterns of these 20 DEGs by representing their normalized counts in boxplots across the three steatosis groups (Figure 2.7). This approach allows us to observe how the expression of these significant genes varies across different degrees of steatosis, offering deeper insights into the potential role these genes play in the progression of steatosis. The boxplots highlight the consistency of expression changes across groups, reinforcing the relevance of these DEGs in the context of steatosis severity.\n\n\nCode\n# Normalize the counts for scWAT data and transpose the matrix\ncounts_norm_sc &lt;- t(counts(dex_sc, normalized = TRUE))\n\n# Subset the metadata for scWAT to match the normalized counts\nmeta_data_sc &lt;- meta_data[rownames(counts_norm_sc), c(\"sexo\", \"steatosis_3cat\")]\n\n# Create a data frame combining normalized counts with metadata\n# Convert the transposed counts to a data frame\nsc &lt;- as.data.frame(counts_norm_sc) |&gt; \n  # Select columns corresponding to the DEGs identified in scWAT\n  select(rownames(degs_sc)) |&gt; \n  # Bind the selected DEGs with the corresponding metadata\n  bind_cols(meta_data_sc) |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data to long format for ggplot, with Gene and Normalized Counts columns\n  pivot_longer(1:nrow(degs_sc), names_to = \"Gene\", values_to = \"Normalized Counts\") |&gt; \n  # Add 1 to avoid infinity in the log scale \n  mutate(`Normalized Counts`=`Normalized Counts` + 1)\n\n\n\n# Function for decorating boxplots of DEGs\ngg_degs &lt;- function() { \n  list(\n    # Apply a log2 transformation to the y-axis (normalized counts)\n    scale_y_continuous(trans = \"log2\"),\n    # Set the x-axis label to \"Steatosis\"\n    labs(x = \"\\nSteatosis\"),\n    # Add a boxplot geometry with specified width and no outliers\n    geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, outliers = FALSE),\n    # Add jittered points for individual observations with transparency\n    geom_jitter(width = 0.25, size = 2, alpha = 0.3),\n    # Add statistical comparison (Kruskal-Wallis test) labels to the plot\n    stat_compare_means(aes(label = paste0(\"p= \", ..p.format..)), \n                       method = \"kruskal.test\",\n                       label.x.npc = 0.3,\n                       label.y.npc = 0.8,\n                       size = 4),\n    # Set custom fill colors for the steatosis categories\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#99c140\", \"#e7b416\", \"#db7b2b\")),\n    # Apply a minimal theme for clean appearance\n    theme_minimal(),\n    # Create facets for each gene, allowing free scaling on the y-axis, with 4 columns of facets\n    facet_wrap(~ Gene, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 4),\n    # Customize theme elements: remove legend, adjust text sizes, and rotate x-axis labels\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          strip.text = element_text(size = 13),\n          axis.title = element_text(size = 13),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 20))\n  )\n}\n\n##############################################\n\n# Plot the normalized counts across steatosis categories for each DEG in scWAT\nggplot(sc, aes(x = steatosis_3cat, y = `Normalized Counts`, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n  # Apply the custom ggplot decorations for DEGs\n  gg_degs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Boxplots of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in scWAT according to the 3 groups of steatosis.Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the normalized counts, with the line inside the box denoting the median.

The Table 2.2 summarizes those molecular functions significantly enriched . Thus, semaphorin receptor binding and chemorepellent activity were up-regulated in the steatotic conditions, while multiple functions related to fatty acid metabolism, lipid transport, microtubule binding, cyclic nucleotide signaling, and nucleic acid processing where appeared down-regulated. This enrichment analysis sheds light on the molecular functions most impacted by steatosis and provides a deeper understanding of the biological processes that are differentially regulated in scWAT as steatosis progresses.\n\n\nCode\n### Gene Ontology (Molecular Function) ###\n\n# Flag up- and down-regulated genes based on adjusted p-value and log2 fold change\ngo_sc &lt;- res_sc |&gt;

To this end the DESeq2 object was also set using the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) method.\n\n\nCode\n# Perform differential expression analysis for liver data\n# Run DESeq2 using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) controlling for the effect of gender (sexo)\ndex_liver &lt;- DESeq(dds_liver,test = \"LRT\",  reduced = ~ sexo)\n\n\nIn the liver tissue analysis, the first step involved calculating the size factor of the libraries to equalize the median of ratios across all samples (Figure 2.8).\n\n\nCode\n# Extract and visualize size factors from the DESeq2 object\nsizeFactors(dex_liver) |&gt; as.data.frame() |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(\"Sample\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::rename(`Size Factors`= \"sizeFactors(dex_liver)\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Sample = str_sub (Sample, 4,6)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Sample, y= `Size Factors`))+\n  geom_col(col=\"darkgrey\", fill = \"grey\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Calculated factor sizes for each sample using the median of ratios method.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe next assessed the variation in gene expression in liver tissue by modeling gene-wise dispersions through a curve-fitting process. Consistent with our observations in the scWAT analysis, the liver data revealed that dispersion generally decreased as mean expression levels increased (Figure 2.9). The limited shrinkage of dispersion estimates, as seen in scWAT, can be attributed to the large number of biological replicates.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate a plot of dispersion estimates using the DESeq2 object\nd2 &lt;- plotDispEsts(dex_liver)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Dispersion plot. Black dots represents single genes and the intial maximum likelihood dispersion estimate (MLE) given the observed data, the red line is the fitted curve to gene-wise dispersion estimates, while blue dots are the shrunken gene-wise dispersion estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3.2 Testing for differential expression\n\n\nCode\n# Use DESeq2 to extract results from the differential expression analysis with FDR adjustment\nres_liver &lt;- results(dex_liver, pAdjustMethod = \"fdr\", independentFiltering = TRUE)\n\n# Convert the results to a data frame for easier manipulation\nres_liver_df &lt;- res_liver |&gt; \n  as.data.frame()\n\n# Filter the results to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs)\n# Keep only those genes with an adjusted p-value (padj) less than 0.05\ndegs_liver &lt;- res_liver_df |&gt; \n  filter(padj &lt; 0.05)\n\n# Count the number of upregulated genes (log2FoldChange &gt; 0)\nup &lt;- sum(res_liver_df$log2FoldChange &gt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Count the number of downregulated genes (log2FoldChange &lt; 0)\ndown &lt;- sum(res_liver_df$log2FoldChange &lt; 0, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\nIn our differential expression analysis using DESeq2 with the LRT model, we initially identified 7748 genes as upregulated and 6810 as downregulated in the liver of individuals with the highest steatosis compared to those with no steatosis. However, when applying a stringent false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of less than 0.05 to identify statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the number of significant DEGs was markedly reduced to 12. Among these, only 1 genes were found to be upregulated, while 11 were downregulated (Table 2.3). The volcano plot (Figure 2.10) illustrates the differential expression of genes in the liver according to steatosis. Among the thousands of genes analyzed, only IGFBP2 showed FDR &lt; 0.05 and substantial changes in expression (Log2 FC &gt; 1).\n\n\nCode\n# Select relevant columns from the significant DEGs in liver data\ndegs_liver |&gt; \n  # Select the log2 fold change, p-value, and adjusted p-value (FDR)\n  select(log2FoldChange, pvalue, fdr = \"padj\") |&gt; \n  # Arrange the results by the FDR (adjusted p-value) in ascending order\n  arrange(fdr) |&gt; \n  # Create a formatted table with specified number of digits for each column\n  kbl(digits = c(2, 5, 3)) |&gt; \n  # Apply striped styling to the table for better visual presentation\n  kable_styling(\"striped\")\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver. fdr: false discovery rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog2FoldChange\npvalue\nfdr\n\n\n\n\nIL32\n0.81\n0.00000\n0.001\n\n\nIGFBP2\n-1.37\n0.00001\n0.008\n\n\nAHCY\n-0.59\n0.00003\n0.014\n\n\nRN7SL1\n-0.72\n0.00003\n0.014\n\n\nRN7SL2\n-0.69\n0.00012\n0.024\n\n\nAPOF\n-0.56\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nCYP3A4\n-0.63\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nSERPINA1\n-0.55\n0.00009\n0.024\n\n\nAKR7A3\n-0.67\n0.00014\n0.024\n\n\nMAT1A\n-0.35\n0.00011\n0.024\n\n\nPC\n-0.43\n0.00011\n0.024\n\n\nSERPINA3\n-0.48\n0.00023\n0.036\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a volcano plot for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver\nEnhancedVolcano(res_liver,\n    # Label the points on the plot with gene names from the rownames of res_liver\n    lab = rownames(res_liver),\n    # Set the main title of the plot\n    title = \"Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver\",\n    # Set the subtitle indicating the comparison groups\n    subtitle = \"&gt;33%  vs. &lt;5% steatosis\",\n    # Customize the legend labels for different categories of DEGs\n    legendLabels = c(\"NS\", expression(Log[2] ~ FC  &gt; 1), \"FDR &lt; 0.05\", expression(FDR &lt; 0.05 ~ and ~ Log[2] ~ FC  &gt; 1)),\n    # Set the caption below the plot (empty in this case)\n    caption = \"\",\n    # Highlight only the selected DEGs in the plot\n    selectLab = rownames(degs_liver),\n    # Set the size of the labels on the plot\n    labSize = 4,\n    # Position the legend to the right of the plot\n    legendPosition = 'right',\n    # Draw lines connecting labels to their corresponding points\n    drawConnectors = TRUE,\n    # Connect labels to points in both directions (from left and right)\n    directionConnectors = \"both\",\n    # Allow for an infinite number of overlapping points to be labeled\n    max.overlaps = Inf,\n    # Set the fold change cutoff for highlighting DEGs\n    FCcutoff = 1,\n    # Specify the column to use for the p-value cutoff\n    pCutoffCol = \"padj\",\n    # Set the p-value cutoff for significance\n    pCutoff = 0.05,\n    # Set the x-axis to represent log2 fold change\n    x = 'log2FoldChange',\n    # Set the y-axis to represent the p-value\n    y = 'pvalue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Volcano plot showing liver DEGs (in red) in individuals with the highest (&gt;33%) compared to the lowest (&lt;5%) degree of steatosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter identifying the DEGs in the liver, we analyzed their expression patterns using boxplots across the three steatosis groups (Figure 2.11). Most of these boxplots revealed a clear, ordered, and stepwise pattern of gene expression, with expression levels consistently and progressively changing as steatosis severity increased from low (&lt;5%) to medium, and then to high (&gt;33%). This graded response suggests that these genes are closely linked to the progression of steatosis, highlighting their potential role as key markers or drivers in the development of the condition.\n\n\nCode\n# Normalize the counts for liver data and transpose the matrix\ncounts_norm_liver &lt;- t(counts(dex_liver, normalized = TRUE))\n\n# Subset the metadata for liver to match the normalized counts\nmeta_data_liver &lt;- meta_data[rownames(counts_norm_liver), c(\"sexo\", \"steatosis_3cat\")]\n\n# Create a data frame combining normalized counts with metadata\n# Convert the transposed counts to a data frame\nliver &lt;- as.data.frame(counts_norm_liver) |&gt; \n  # Select columns corresponding to the DEGs identified in liver data\n  select(rownames(degs_liver)) |&gt; \n  # Bind the selected DEGs with the corresponding metadata\n  bind_cols(meta_data_liver) |&gt; \n  # Reshape the data to long format for ggplot, with Gene and Normalized Counts columns\n  pivot_longer(1:nrow(degs_liver), names_to = \"Gene\", values_to = \"Normalized Counts\") |&gt; \n  # Add 1 to the normalized counts to avoid issues with log transformation\n  mutate(`Normalized Counts` = `Normalized Counts` + 1)\n\n# Plot the normalized counts across steatosis categories for each DEG in liver\nggplot(liver, aes(x = steatosis_3cat, y = `Normalized Counts`, fill = steatosis_3cat)) +\n  # Apply the custom ggplot decorations for DEGs (using the gg_degs function defined earlier)\n  gg_degs()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Boxplots of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in liver according to the 3 groups of steatosis.Each box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the normalized counts, with the line inside the box denoting the median. The whiskers extend to show the range of the data, excluding outliers, which are plotted as individual points.p: p-value for the Kruskal-Wallis test for the comparison between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3.3 Gene ontology enrichment\nLastly, in our RNAseq analysis of liver tissue from individuals with varying degrees of steatosis, we identified specific molecular functions associated with selected DEGs through gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The Table 2.4 summarizes the molecular functions that were significantly enriched. For instance, cytokine activity was upregulated, as indicated by the enrichment of IL32. In contrast, various functions related to oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and enzyme activity, such as aldo-keto reductase activity, cholesterol binding, steroid binding, and oxidoreductase activity, were downregulated, involving genes like AKR7A3, APOF, and CYP3A4. Additionally, functions related to protease binding and growth factor binding, linked to genes such as SERPINA1, SERPINA3, and IGFBP2, were also downregulated. This GO enrichment analysis provides insights into the molecular functions most affected by steatosis in liver tissue, offering a deeper understanding of the biological processes that are differentially regulated as steatosis progresses.\n\n\nCode\n### Gene Ontology (Molecular Function) ###\n\n# Flag up- and down-regulated genes based on adjusted p-value and log2 fold change\ngo_liver &lt;- res_liver |&gt;

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nAdipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis are closely linked metabolic disorders that significantly impact global health. Both conditions are highly heritable, underscoring the importance of genetic studies for understanding their etiology and progression. Exome sequencing, which focuses on the coding regions of the genome, presents a robust approach for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of these disorders and identifying potential biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic intervention.\nThe advantages of exome sequencing are manifold. By targeting the exonic regions, which harbor the majority of disease-related variants, this method offers a cost-effective yet comprehensive strategy to capture the genetic diversity underlying complex traits like adipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis. Such precision is crucial for dissecting the biological mechanisms at play and for the eventual translation of genetic insights into clinical practice.\nGenetic association studies, including Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Exome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS), are instrumental in this research. GWAS examines common genetic variants across the genome to identify those associated with a trait, whereas EWAS focuses specifically on variants within the exome. The latter can be particularly revealing for diseases believed to be influenced by coding variants, providing a more focused view of potential causal mutations.\nSignificant genes identified in the context of adipose tissue dysfunction and liver steatosis include PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and GCKR, among others [1]. These genes have been implicated in metabolic processes and fat distribution within cells, highlighting their roles in the pathophysiology of these conditions.\nExpression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis further enriches our understanding by linking specific genetic variants with gene expression levels. This integration of genomics and transcriptomics in a multi-omic approach allows researchers to elucidate the functional consequences of genetic variants, particularly how they impact gene expression in different tissues under various physiological and pathological states.\nIn the context of obesity, where both adipose tissue and liver function are often compromised, a multi-omic strategy is invaluable. It enables the identification of biomarkers that are not only indicative of disease presence but also of its progression and response to treatment. Such biomarkers are crucial for developing targeted therapies that address the specific molecular profiles of individual patients.",

Hybridization capture of libraries was proceeded according to the following procedures. Briefly, the prepped libraries were hybridized in the buffer with biotin-labeled probes, and magnetic beads with streptavidin were used to capture the exons of genes. Subsequently, non-hybridized fragments were washed out and probes were digested. The captured libraries were enriched by PCR amplification (Figure 3.1).\nThe library was checked with Qubit and real-time PCR for quantification and bioanalyzer for size distribution detection.

    "section": "3.4 Computational Analysis: Variant Calling",
    "text": "3.4 Computational Analysis: Variant Calling\nThe analysis adhered to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices for variant discovery, which includes recommendations for quality score recalibration and variant filtering. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the variant calling process by applying stringent quality controls and leveraging the comprehensive analytical capabilities of GATK tools.\n\n3.4.1 Nextflow Workflow Management\nThe computational analyses were conducted using Nextflow (v23.10.1), a workflow management system that enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. The analyses were orchestrated through the nf-core framework, which provides community-curated bioinformatics pipelines [2].\n\n\n3.4.2 Variant Calling with Sarek Pipeline\nThe variant calling was performed using the nf-core/sarek pipeline (version 3.4.1) [3]. This pipeline is specifically designed for the analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and targeted sequencing data from cancer studies, facilitating comprehensive genomic analyses from raw sequencing data to annotated variants.\nThe pipeline was executed with the following command:\n\nnextflow run nf-core/sarek -r 3.4.1\\\n-profile docker\\\n-bg\\\n-resume\\\n--wes\\\n--input samplesheet.csv\\\n--outdir /Resultados\\\n--genome GATK.GRCh38\\\n--tools freebayes\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Pipeline Configuration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption/Flag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnextflow run nf-core/sarek\nInitiates the execution of the nf-core/sarek pipeline using Nextflow.\n\n\n-r 3.4.1\nSpecifies that version 3.4.1 of the sarek pipeline should be used, ensuring reproducibility of the analysis.\n\n\n-profile docker\nConfigures the pipeline to run using Docker containers, which encapsulate all necessary software dependencies.\n\n\n-bg\nRuns the Nextflow process in the background, allowing other tasks to be performed simultaneously without interruption.\n\n\n-resume\nEnables the pipeline to resume from the last checkpoint if interrupted, saving time and computational resources.\n\n\n--wes\nIndicates that the pipeline is configured to process Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data.\n\n\n--input /mnt/jmarbones/samplesheet.csv\nSpecifies the path to the CSV file containing metadata about the samples to be analyzed.\n\n\n--outdir /mnt/jmarbones/Resultados\nDesignates the directory where all output from the pipeline will be stored.\n\n\n--genome GATK.GRCh38\nSets the reference genome to GATK GRCh38, a standard human genome assembly used in genomic analysis.\n\n\n--tools freebayes\nSpecifies Freebayes as the tool for calling genetic variants, effective for detecting SNPs and small indels.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Pipeline Execution\nThe pipeline was configured to run in a Docker containerized environment, ensuring that all dependencies were consistently managed and the computational environment was isolated. This setup facilitates the reproducibility of results across different computing platforms. The analysis was executed in the background, allowing other processes to run simultaneously without interruption. In the event of an interruption, the pipeline was designed to resume from the last successful step, optimizing resource use and reducing redundancy.\n\n\n3.4.5 Data input and processing\nInput data (clean fastq.gz files) were organized in a CSV file (samplesheet.csv), which included essential metadata such as sample identifiers and sequencing data paths. The output was directed to a designated directory Resultados for organized storage and easy access to results.\nThe human reference genome GATK GRCh38 was utilized to align sequencing data and call variants, providing a standardized basis for the analysis. Variant calling was performed using Freebayes, a tool known for its effectiveness in detecting small variants like SNPs and indels [4].\nThe called variants were stored in Variant Call Format (VCF) files, which include detailed metadata and structured data about each variant detected.\n\n\n3.4.6 VCF processing anf PLINK transformation\nThe next computational steps were carried out with the programs bcftools and PLINK in the command line using . Normalization, performed using bcftools norm, corrects for base misalignments and merges multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs) into single entries, ensuring that variants are represented consistently across datasets. This process was executed on individual VCF files, which were then indexed for efficient access. Following normalization, the bcftools merge command was employed to merge all normalized VCF files into a single file. This merging step is crucial for subsequent analyses as it compiles all variant data into a unified dataset, facilitating easier manipulation and analysis. Subsequently, duplicate variants were removed using bcftools norm with the --rm-dup option, targeting both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions-deletions (indels). This removal is essential to prevent redundancy in variant representation, which can skew allele frequency calculations and other statistical analyses.\nThe final preprocessing step involved transforming the VCF file for compatibility with the PLINK toolset, a widely used software package for genome association studies. The plink command was utilized to convert VCF data into binary ped files while applying several filters: only SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 0.05 were retained, and variants with more than 30% missing genotyping information were excluded. Additionally, a stringent Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium threshold was set to minimize the inclusion of potentially erroneous genotypes. This transformation prepares the dataset for robust statistical analyses, allowing for the exploration of genetic associations and population structure with high reliability.\n\n\nCode\n\n#########################################\n### 1) Script to normalize and merge vcfs\n#########################################\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set the directory to search for VCF files\nVCF_DIR=$1\n\n# Check if directory is provided\nif [ -z \"$VCF_DIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"Usage: $0 /path/to/vcf_directory\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Create a temporary directory for normalized files\nTEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)\necho \"Temporary directory for normalized VCFs: $TEMP_DIR\"\n\n# Find all .vcf.gz files recursively in the directory\nVCF_FILES=$(find \"$VCF_DIR\" -name \"*.vcf.gz\")\n\n# Normalize each VCF file and index it\nfor INPUT_VCF in $VCF_FILES; do\n  OUTPUT_VCF=\"$TEMP_DIR/$(basename \"$INPUT_VCF\" .vcf.gz).norm.vcf.gz\"\n  echo \"Normalizing $INPUT_VCF to $OUTPUT_VCF\"\n  \n  # Normalize using bcftools\n  bcftools norm -m -both -o \"$OUTPUT_VCF\" -O z \"$INPUT_VCF\" --threads 8\n  \n  # Check if normalization was successful\n  if [ -s \"$OUTPUT_VCF\" ]; then\n    # Index the normalized VCF if it's not empty\n    tabix -p vcf \"$OUTPUT_VCF\"\n  else\n    echo \"Warning: Normalized VCF $OUTPUT_VCF is empty.\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n# List all normalized VCF files\nNORMALIZED_VCFS=$(find \"$TEMP_DIR\" -name \"*.norm.vcf.gz\")\n\n# Check if any normalized VCF files exist\nif [ -z \"$NORMALIZED_VCFS\" ]; then\n  echo \"Error: No normalized VCF files found.

The .bim file contained 10,832,436 variants, of which 9,248,936 were successfully loaded, demonstrating a comprehensive coverage of the genetic data. During this process, missing variant identifiers were appropriately assigned.\nDespite this substantial data inclusion, the overall genotyping rate was notably low at 3.57% after removing 9,184,238 variants due to extensive missing genotype data. Furthermore, deviations observed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium resulted in the elimination of 4,504 variants through an exact test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. An additional 11,342 variants were excluded based on minor allele frequency thresholds.\nAfter enforcing all quality control measures and variant filters, only 48,852 variants across 80 individuals remained, meeting the criteria for inclusion in further analyses.The significantly low genotyping rate observed could be attributed to the high number of SNPs unique to individual VCF files and not replicated across the cohort. This uniqueness might stem from intrinsic biological diversity or variations in sample processing techniques.\n\n\n3.4.7 Experimental design\nFor this exercise, a standard case-control analysis was carried out comparing 29 obese individuals with no steatosis vs. 25 individuals with more than 33% of statosis.",

There were no statistically significant differences across any of the variables assessed, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and liver fibrosis stages (Table 3.1). Median age distributions across the groups were 47, 51, and 51 years, respectively, with a p-value of 0.505, indicating uniform age distribution across the groups. Gender ratios were similarly consistent, comprising approximately 75% females and 25% males in each group, with a p-value of 0.913. BMI values, with medians of 49.2, 43.9, and 45.9 for the respective groups, also showed no significant variation (p=0.563). Even the categorization of liver fibrosis stages from F0 to F4 did not demonstrate significant differences across the groups (p=0.172), underscoring a lack of correlation between the variables studied and the percentage of liver fat. This uniformity highlights the absence of significant demographic or clinical variations among the different levels of liver steatosis within the cohort.\n\n\nCode\n# tables with the descriptive analysis of phenotype\ncdesc &lt;- compareGroups (steatosis_3cat ~ edad + sexo + imc + Fibrosis.cat ,pheno, method=2)\ntdesc &lt;- createTable(cdesc, show.p.mul = T, show.all = T)\nexport2md(tdesc, caption = \"\") |&gt; \n    kable_styling(font_size = 11) |&gt; \n    remove_column(c(7,9)) \n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Main phenotypic characterists in the genotyped cohort according to liver fat percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[ALL]\n&lt;5%\n5-33%\n&gt;33%\np.overall\np.&lt;5% vs &gt;33%\n\n\n\n\n\nN=80\nN=29\nN=26\nN=25\n\n\n\n\nedad\n49.0 [41.0;55.0]\n47.0 [41.0;52.0]\n51.0 [42.5;56.8]\n51.0 [41.0;54.0]\n0.505\n0.497\n\n\nsexo:\n\n\n\n\n0.913\n1.000\n\n\nhombre\n20 (25.0%)\n7 (24.1%)\n6 (23.1%)\n7 (28.0%)\n\n\n\n\nmujer\n60 (75.0%)\n22 (75.9%)\n20 (76.9%)\n18 (72.0%)\n\n\n\n\nimc\n45.9 [41.6;50.5]\n49.2 [41.5;51.3]\n43.9 [41.6;50.4]\n45.9 [42.7;46.9]\n0.563\n0.695\n\n\nFibrosis.cat:\n\n\n\n\n0.172\n0.161\n\n\nF0\n59 (74.7%)\n25 (89.3%)\n19 (73.1%)\n15 (60.0%)\n\n\n\n\nF1\n13 (16.5%)\n2 (7.14%)\n4 (15.4%)\n7 (28.0%)\n\n\n\n\nF2\n6 (7.59%)\n1 (3.57%)\n3 (11.5%)\n2 (8.00%)\n\n\n\n\nF2-F4\n1 (1.27%)\n0 (0.00%)\n0 (0.00%)\n1 (4.00%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData represent median[IQR] or number of cases (%).\np.overall: Kruskal-Wallis´ associated p-value.\np.5-33% vs &gt;33%: p- value for the comparison between &lt;5% vs &gt;33% steatosis (Mann-Whithney)\n\n\n3.5.2 Population structure\nFirst, we aimed to investigate population structure and ancestry, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore genetic variation. We first transformed genetic data from PLINK to GDS format for efficiency and applied linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning to focus on significant SNPs, essential for PCA’s computational efficiency. The pruned SNPs were analyzed using PCA to visualize the population structure, revealing no distinct clustering by sex but some dispersion related to liver steatosis levels (Figure 3.2).\nThe PCA results indicated subtle genetic variability associated with liver steatosis, suggesting its potential to influence outcomes in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Given this variability, we recommend incorporating principal components as covariates in GWAS to adjust for underlying population structure, thereby enhancing the robustness of GWAS findings. This approach ensures that associations detected are due to genuine genetic influences rather than confounding factors, demonstrating the strategic integration of data transformation, pruning, and analysis in genetic studies.\n\n\nCode\n# Transform PLINK data into GDS format for more efficient data manipulation\nsnpgdsBED2GDS(\"/Users/arbones/Dropbox/SyncBriefcase/LAB/IACS/multiomicas_FIS/results_WES/variant_calling/freebayes/only_snps_cleaned.bed\", \n              \"/Users/arbones/Dropbox/SyncBriefcase/LAB/IACS/multiomicas_FIS/results_WES/variant_calling/freebayes/only_snps_cleaned.fam\",\n              \"/Users/arbones/Dropbox/SyncBriefcase/LAB/IACS/multiomicas_FIS/results_WES/variant_calling/freebayes/only_snps_cleaned.bim\", \n              out.gdsfn =\"GDS\")\n\n# Open the GDS file for further analysis\ngenofile &lt;- snpgdsOpen(\"GDS\")\n\n# Set a random seed for reproducibility in stochastic processes\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# Retrieve column names from genofile, which include SNP identifiers\nsnps.qc &lt;- colnames(geno)\n\n# Perform linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning to reduce SNP redundancy\nsnp.prune &lt;- snpgdsLDpruning(genofile, ld.threshold = 0.2,\n                             snp.id = snps.qc)\n\n# Extract SNP IDs after LD pruning for use in population ancestry analysis\nsnps.ibd &lt;- unlist(snp.prune, use.names=FALSE)\n\n# Calculate identity by descent (IBD) matrix using pruned SNPs\nibd &lt;- snpgdsIBDMoM(genofile, kinship=TRUE,\n                    snp.id = snps.ibd,\n                    num.thread = 6)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Perform PCA on the genomic data to investigate population structure\npca &lt;- snpgdsPCA(genofile, sample.id=family$member,\n                 snp.id = snps.ibd, \n                 num.thread=8,\n                 verbose = F)\n\n# Close the GDS file after analysis to free resources\nclosefn.gds(genofile)\n\n\n# Bind the PCA components t othe phenotype data\npca.comp &lt;- cbind(ID=pca$sample.id,pca$eigenvect[, 1:2]) |&gt; \n    as.data.frame() |&gt; \n    set_names(c(\"ID\", \"PC1\",\"PC2\"))\n\nrownames(pca.comp) &lt;- substr(pca.comp$ID,1,7)\npca.comp$ID &lt;-  NULL\n\npheno.qc.pca &lt;- pca.comp[match(rownames(pheno),rownames(pca.comp)),] |&gt; \n    bind_cols(pheno) |&gt; \n    filter(steatosis_3cat != \"5-33%\") |&gt; \n    mutate(sexo = as.factor (sexo)) |&gt; \n    mutate(steatosis_3cat =droplevels(steatosis_3cat )) |&gt; \n    mutate(across(c(PC1,PC2), \\(x) as.numeric(x)))\n\n\ngeno.qc &lt;- geno[rownames(pheno.qc.pca ),]\n\n# Plot the first two principal components to visualize population structure\nggplot (pheno.qc.pca,aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, colour = steatosis_3cat, shape = sex))+\n    geom_point(size=4, alpha= 0.5)+\n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Population structure obtained by plotting the first two axes of the genetic variation (PC1 and PC2) from PCA of the SNP matrix.

    "text": "3.6 Genome-wide association analysis\nIn our study, we assessed the risk of potential inflation in genetic associations due to undetected latent variables using a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. This plot is crucial for evaluating whether the observed chi-squared (χ2) statistics from our genetic associations deviate from the expected distribution under the null hypothesis of no association. A Q-Q plot helps identify potential inflation caused by population stratification, cryptic relatedness, or other confounding factors. In our results, as shown in Figure 3.3, the Q-Q plot demonstrated that the observed χ2 values closely aligned with the expected values, indicated by a lambda (λ) close to 1. This suggests that our estimates are not significantly inflated, providing confidence in the validity of our genetic association findings.\n\n\nCode\n# Perform single SNP tests for the 'steatosis_3cat' trait using phenotype and genotype data\nres &lt;- single.snp.tests(steatosis_3cat, data=pheno.qc.pca, snp.data=geno.qc)\n\n# Calculate chi-squared statistics from the test results\nchi2 &lt;- chi.squared(res, df=1)\n\n# Generate a Q-Q plot of the chi-squared statistics to assess inflation\nqq.chisq(chi2, main = \"\")\n\n\n           N      omitted       lambda \n48852.000000     0.000000     1.002291 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: QQ plot of observed vs expected p values\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our genetic association study, we utilized the snp.rhs.tests function from the snpStats package to investigate the relationship between the trait steatosis and SNPs, factoring in potential confounders such as sex and principal components PC1 and PC2. This function is specifically designed to fit a generalized linear model (GLM) where the phenotype is treated as the dependent variable. Importantly, this model allows for the inclusion of one or more covariates— in this case, reported sex and the principal components — which serve as independent variables. These covariates are critical as they help control for potential confounders that could influence the phenotype-genotype association, thus providing a more accurate interpretation of the genetic data.\n\n\nCode\n# Perform SNP-based tests adjusting for principal components PC1 and PC2\nres.adj &lt;- snp.rhs.tests(steatosis_3cat ~ sex + PC1 + PC2, data=pheno.qc.pca, snp.data=geno.qc,\n                         family = \"binomial\", robust = T)\n\n# Extract p-values and genomic annotations for SNPs\npvals &lt;- data.frame(SNP=annotation$snp.name, \n                    CHR=annotation$chromosome,\n                    BP=annotation$position,\n                    P=p.value(res.adj))\n\n# Calculate Bonferroni correction threshold for significance\nbonferroni &lt;- 0.05/ncol(geno.qc)\nbonferroni.log &lt;- -log10(bonferroni)\n\n# Plot Manhattan plot of p-values across the genome\nmanhattan(pvals, col=c(\"lightblue\", \"blue\"),\n          annotatePval = FALSE,annotateTop = FALSE,\n          genomewideline = FALSE,suggestiveline = FALSE,\n          ylim=c(0,7.2), cex=2)\n\n# Add significance threshold lines to the plot\nabline(h = bonferroni.log, col=\"red\", lwd=2, lty=2)\nabline(h = -log10(0.0001), col=\"darkblue\", lwd=1)\n\n# Significant SNPs\ntopSNPs &lt;- pvals |&gt; \n    filter(P&lt;0.0001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Plot of the p-values for each SNP in the GWAS by their position in the genome.

Significance at Bonferroni level was set at p = 10\\(^{-6}\\)as we tested 48852 SNPs. The level corresponds to -log10(P) = 5.99. Notably, while no SNP surpassed the stringent Bonferroni threshold, 9 SNPs did exhibit p-values below 0.0001. These results suggest subtle genetic influences that could potentially impact steatosis.\n\n\n\n\n1. Anstee QM, Day CP (2013) The genetics of NAFLD.
